Specific'Aims:
in the:US;, there:has been a‘polarized:debate:about whether lifé,.long-term:care,,and disability insurers,

vas:Huntington’s Disease.or Lynch Syndrome.-In-reality; most.variants havea wide range of predictive.values;
from unknowh'to'low:to high. There has:been little. debate about:how predictive a-variant must befor’

‘predictive:variants, medical:interventions:may be available to:minimize‘one’s indicated ,risk,.and the.law does
‘ot currently shed light‘on how: insurérs should consider this information. Staté.unfair trade practice laws
generally require: itisurers to have actuarial justification forusing any tisk factor in undétwriting: Under these.
actuarial laws, to:denyan-application archarge an increased premium, insurers must show:that a:relevant risk
factor‘is’statistically. associated with increased insurer cost: However, in the US; theré.has been little research
regarding ‘the application of these standards to’ genétic’and: genomic data. Internationally; several couritries;.
sUich.as.the UK and Australia, have had actuarial policies for supplemental insurers specific'to genetic:-testing
‘sincetheearly:2000s: Thus, most:of the academiciand policy discussions in-this:area have.occurred abroad..
‘Although the: Genetic. Information: Nondiserimination Act (GINA) protects:against-genetic-discrimination:in _
employment:and:health insurarice; individuals may<fail to. undertake medically recommended:clinical genetic

not‘explore:the broader. criteria that inform: when:and how-such:information:can legally-be used.;Once:studied,.
‘these. criteria‘can ifforrfi/a more: htianced policy discussion‘of the“should’. This. project has two primary goals:
‘1)'to systematically:examine the legal-and policy landscapé.of supplemental insurer use. of genetic information
in:the: US and internationally -with:particular-focus on requirements:of-actuarial justification; and:2) to.use:these:
réquirements tovoffer‘a variety-of policy,options:for US: state:and federal governments that.seékito-address
‘genetic discritination'in supplemerital insurance: To meet these goals; | propose three:specific. dims:
Aim'1.—Analyze: how intérmational.approaches:to ‘actuarial justification; supplemental insurance, and:génetic
information maybe applicable-to'the-US. Using methods.and analysis techniques. acquired during the
mentored-phase, Iwill: choose four‘countries:that have robust policies:regarding actuarial justification:and:

in‘the ‘international privatized supplemental insurance sector ensures.a more direct comparison with the US;

whether'these:policies:address' issues:related to‘predictive-value or preventive measures, -how‘effective the
policiés have béeh, ‘and. what lessons were learned. Case-study analysis-will combine both policy analysisand
targeted ‘interviews,with key’ stakeholders such.as:academic/policy experts, government officials, advocacy’
-group:representatives,:and insurance: representatives.
Aim:2 = Interrogate how existing US ‘state: laws-that require: actuarial justification in-supplemental:insurance
would:apply-to-use of genetic:information. Using multiple:methods, | will:explore how .current:state law:may
are.interpreting:and enforcing actuarial.and unfair trade, practice laws. (Aim:2a), |:will. combine«this-with legal

responses will inform the’ legal'analysis of how existing legislation may-be enforced or interpreted,
Aim:3 — Provide policy analysis:and recommendations. for legislative.and regulatory options to address:
‘concerns about the use of genetic:information.in:supplemental insurance: | will undertake policy analysis:of

(Mittra2007). There has been little research and'policy discussion of, if supplemental insurers have access to

examines how law:and policy“address, or’should address;'the thiteshold of statistical ‘sigriificarice between
‘genetic information:and increased ‘risk necessary for insurers to charge higher premium rates or:deny:a policy.
‘In, 2008;-in, response to, the-public's-concetnis of genetic discrimination, Congress: passed ‘the Genetic
Information. Nondiserimination.Act:(GINA).;GINA prevents:employers.and health: insurers from using:genetic

2009)::Thése insurers were not included in GINA dué ‘to political compromise’and recognition that the:
‘economic.models‘and social goals of:'supplemental insurance:raise-different:policy considerations than health

discrifination in‘supplemental insurance (Allain 2042, Laedtke.2012,.Parkrnati:2014). This fear may lead

‘Sinee:federal law does not address supplemental. insurer‘use’of genetic information, any US-based policy: in

‘genetic information. By begining, the inquiry with:how. insurers Can fairly or legally use.Such information, rather
‘than if they-should:-use it:at-all, this project. can provide new-insight:to:an-entrenched US:debate. Focusing on

‘also. novel in its recognition’ of the importance of mentorship in the'ROO phase-and the inclusion’of'a specific
professional:development component on mentorship within:the training plan.
‘Approach:
‘Aim1: Analyze How international approaches to actuarial justification;:supplemental'insurance, and: genetic.
‘information may.be:applicable to‘the:US.
Aim'1 Rationale: ‘Several countries have long’ established policies: that impose actuarial justification standards
orregulate supplementalinsurers:in'the.context of, genetic.information..Because these:countries often have
universal health ‘care:systems that limit:concertns'of discrimination and accéss:in.the health cate’setting, policy:
‘discussiois regarding corcems.about genetic discrimination have’ focused. on'the:supplemental insurances
‘thatare often privatized (Anderlik'2001, Knoppers:2004b). Compared to the US, these:countries are.generally:
morecadvanced in policyimplementation ‘in the:context-of supplemental-insurance:(Van Hoyweghen:2007);
There:are three primary:avenues ‘that'countties have used to:address:supplemental insurer.use of:genetic. —
information.(Knoppers:2004a, Lemmens:2003), although within-these broad strategies'thére‘are’a variety'of
types Of policies (Joly;2010,.Lemke.2013, Otlowski2012, Quinn-2014, Vatga 2012). First, ifisuréts:in some-
‘countties have:voluntarily‘agreed to:a moratorium on-the use of genetic information for:applications,below:a:
certain motietary Valueand to a:requirement of‘actuarial justification.for-those:above that:value (Huijgen-2012,,
‘Soini:2012);.For example, sirice 2001, suppléiiénital instirérs'in ‘the United Kingdom have had a.voluntary.
moratorium,.which was just recently:extended' to:2019 (HMG 2011, Thomas:2012). Second, some countries:
‘have:passed: legislation at.the‘federal level requiring actuarial justification in this-area.(Soini:2012,’Van
Hoyweghen:2012): Utilizing this-stratégy, Australia Has: legislation that requirés:certain supplemental insurers
to-have‘acttarial justification for'using genetic. information (ALRC-2003, Kéogh'2013, Taylor 2004): Third,.

Aim 3'-:Provide policy analysis:and.recommendations for legislative and:regulatory options‘to address:
concerns about the:use of-genetic information in:supplemental insurance:
Aim:3 Rationale; Since‘the-passage:of GINA, ‘there has:been:discussion.of whether the federal. government:
‘should:pass:additional-legislation that:expands:protection. against genetic:discrimination in supplemental
‘insurances. There’ate.strong competing interésts on both:sides‘of this debate: Individuals fear the misusé-of’
their genetic information-and supplemental insurers-fear the. economic consequences;and‘adverse-selection in
their businesses (Daykin:2003, Haidle-2014,-Macdonald 2002, Rothstein & Joly: 2009). These competing views:
‘create-diffictlt policy decisions ‘for state and fédéral legislators. However, ifitérnational and US'state;
experiénces to date.can provide valuable:insight into. the-feasibility, implications,.and benefits-of various. policy:
options. Aim 3.of.this:project:will synthesize:information and data:collected through.Aims 1 and 2 to:create

legislative options:available at-the-federal-and state level to address supplemental insurer use. of genetic

Since:the policy analysis of. Aim:3 will occur in Years 4 and:5, itis possible that new state. or federal legislation:
