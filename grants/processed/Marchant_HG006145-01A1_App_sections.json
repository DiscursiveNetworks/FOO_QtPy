Physicians, a key gatekeeper in the uptake of PM, are at the greatest risk of liability. Currently,\nthere is great uncertainty, disagreement and rapid change with regard to the use of PM tests in clinical care. It\nis during this period of uncertainty and change where the potential for liability is at its greatest and thus the\nneed for comprehensive legal research and analysis of the intersection of these issues is most pressing. This\nproposed project seeks to fill the gap in the understanding of PM liability risks by providing legal docirinal,\nempirical, and policy research on the risks, impacts and possible policy approaches with regard to PM liability.\nThe results of this project can help to better understand and predict the future course of PM and to identify the\nkey legal and policy levers that may be available to ensure that liability plays a beneficial rather than\n\n| detrimental role in the implementation of PM. This project has five primary objectives. This project will provide\na comprehensive investigation and analysis of potential liability to physicians, first by examining the applicable\nclaims, defenses and doctrines that will, provide the legal framework for liability, and which themselves are\ncurrently undergoing important changes. Second, we will evaluate the potential risks of liability to physicians\nby integrating the doctrinal analysis with the fact patterns and evidence in four likely PM case studies, as well\nas by evaluating liability lessons from the uptake of previous medical technologies and practices. Third, we will\nexamine the likely impact liability will have on physicians, patients, and the broader adoption, availability and\nimplementation of PM. Fourth, we will identify and evaluate policy tools that can be used to better manage\nrisks and uncertainties in the PM arena. Finally, we will communicate the findings and implications of our\nproject through an outreach program targeting three key stakeholder groups: (i) physicians and medical\neducators; {ii) patient groups and advocates; and (ili) legal practitioners (including judges). At this critical\njuncture in the rollout of PM, before widespread liability has taken hold, it is very important and useful to\ncomprehensively study and make widely available the best information and projections of the risks and\nrelevant factors for physician liability relating to PM.\n\nProject Description Page 7\n"

Yet, the emergence and implementation of PM has been slower than many anticipated. Scientific\ncomplexity and uncertainties, the need for validation of biomarkers, commercial unavailability of relevant\ndiagnostic tests, economic costs, lack of reimbursement for diagnostic testing, regulatory approval barriers,\nstructural problems in the existing health care delivery system, inadequate business models, physician\neducational gaps and resistance, and intellectual property issues have all been identified as potential factors\nimpeding the implementation of PM. One factor that has not been subject to much attention to date, but is likely\nto play an increasingly significant role in the future, is the potential for liability. In particular, physicians, a key\n| gatekeeper in the uptake in PM, are most at risk of liability relating to PM due to their lack of available\ndefenses, limited training in genetics, and legal doctrinal trends that will be further evaluated in this project.\nIndeed, the first PM lawsuits are already being pursued in the courts, and a rapid ramp-up of such litigation can\nbe expected over the next few years, particularly if some of the initial lawsuits are successful. Uncertainties\nabout the benefits, costs and standards for applying PM technologies and tests will further clinical adoption of\nsome PM technologies and practices, while potentially deterring others, affecting the availability, safety and\nbenefits of PM innovations for patients. Notwithstanding the major role that liability risks and uncertainties are\nlikely to play in the implementation and direction of PM, relatively little doctrinal, empirical or policy research\nhas been conducted on this issue to date.\nThis project proposes to examine the nature and risks of potential PM-related liability for physicians, the key\ndoctrinal and evidentiary issues that will determine the potential likelihood and success of such lawsuits, the\nlikely impacts of liability risks on the development and direction of PM, and potential policy tools to better\nmanage liability risks and uncertainties. It will then seek to communicate the findings and implications of our\nresearch to key stakeholder groups. Specifically, this project aims to:\n\n1. Identify the legal claims, defenses and doctrines, including current trends and changes in these key\nlegal criteria, that will affect liability for physicians relating to PM;\n\n2. Evaluate the risks of PM-related liability to physicians by integrating the doctrinal analysis with the fact\npatterns in four likely PM case studies, as well as by analyzing lessons from previous examples of\nphysician liability relating to new medical technologies and procedures;\n\n3. Explore the potential impacts of physician liability on the development and direction of PM, including\nphysician practices and patient access to and benefit from PM;\n\n4. Identify and evaluate potential policy options for better management of physician liability risks and\nuncertainties relating to PM; and\n\n5. Conduct outreach on the findings and implications of our research to key stakeholder groups (including\nphysicians, physician educators, patient groups, and legal practitioners (including judges}) to help them\nbetter prepare for and anticipate future liability trends and impacts.\n\nSpecific Aims Page 45\n"

Significance\nThere are many obstacles affecting the implementation of personalized medicine {PM}, including scientific\ncomplexity and uncertainty, the need for validation of biomarkers, economic costs, lack of reimbursement for\ndiagnostic testing, regulatory approval barriers, structural problems in the existing health care delivery system,\nlack of physician training and motivation, inadequate business models, and intellectual property issues. One\npotentially important factor that has received less attention to date, but which could be enormously influential in\nthe uptake and future direction of PM, is liability. While liability could potentially affect all actors in the PM\nlifecycle -- including drug and device manufacturers, test providers and testing labs, health care providers,\nthird-party payors, and pharmacists — physicians are at the greatest risk of liability and their behavior is most\nlikely to be influenced by potential liability relating to PM (Marchant et al. 2011; Marchant et al 2006}. This\nproposal will therefore focus on physicians and their patients, and the impact that liability may have on them in\nthe context of PM.\nLiability can be a powerful incentive for actors to take appropriate measures to protect public health and safety,\nor it can skew priorities and practices in socially disadvantageous ways. Thus, liability has the potential to have\n| both beneficial and detrimental influences on whether and how physicians uptake PM. Liability may speed up\nthe development and clinical use of some PM technologies and practices, while deterring others.\nNotwithstanding the potential importance of liability in influencing the future direction and uptake of PM,\nrelatively little is known about, and very little research has been conducted on, the liability risks associated with\nPM and their likely impacts. This proposed project seeks to fill that gap by providing legal doctrinal, empirical,\n| and policy research on the risks, impacts and possible policy approaches with regard to PM liability for\nphysicians. The results of this project can help to better understand and predict the future course of PM, to\nidentify the key legal and policy levers that may be available to ensure that liability plays a beneficial rather\n| than detrimental role in the implementation of PM, and to provide guidance to physicians, patients, attorneys\nand judges on PM liability issues .\nIn this section, we first provide a brief description of PM and its current status, followed by a more extensive\n| discussion of potential liability risks to physicians and why the potential liability in the burgeoning field of PM is\nunique and pressing issue that needs to be comprehensively analyzed and addressed.\n1. Brief Description and Status of Personalized Medicine\nThe practice of medicine in the United States is on the verge of a profound paradigm shift from the “one size\nfits all” approach of the past to individualized care in which a new generation of molecular diagnostics will be\nused to target treatments to the unique genetic and molecular profile of individual patients and their diseases.\nAs NIH Director Francis Collins recently noted, “[t]he power of the molecular approach to health and disease\nhas steadily gained momentum over the past several decades and is now poised to catalyze a revolution in\nmedicine” (Collins, 2010). Notwithstanding the enormous potential and excitement about the dawning era of\nPM, the implementation of PM has turned out to be slower and more complex than many experts originally\nanticipated (SACGHS, 2008; The Royal Society, 2005).\nToday, there is substantial uncertainty and disagreement about the appropriate use of genetics and other\npersonalized medicine data in clinical care, giving rise to the types of disagreemenis and disputes that can\nspawn litigation. On one hand, some experts claim certain PM techniques are ready for clinical application\ntoday, and several leading medical institutions have begun to deploy such techniques (Personalized Medicine\nCoalition, 2009; Flockhart et al., 2009; Lesko, 2007). Experts with this perspective have expressed frustration\nthat physicians and other stakeholders in the health care system have been too slow to uptake PM metheds\nand tools (Lesko & Woodcock, 2004; Evans, 2006), Other experts, however, are more skeptical about the\nnear-term deployment of PM, contending that such methods are not likely to benefit patient care and are not\nyet ready for widespread adoption (The Royal Society, 2005; Nebert & Vesell, 2004).\nResearch Strategy Page 46\n"

In such a period of uncertainty, the potential for liability is at its greatest.\n\n| 2. Liability Docirines Affecting Personalized Medicine\nOne factor that may accelerate (appropriately or inappropriately) the widespread clinical use of personalized\n\n| medicine is liability (Marchant et al., 2011; SACGHS, 2008; Roth 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Evans, 2006;\nOssorio, 2001). A patient who suffers a serious adverse effect from a pharmaceutical for which he or she\ncarries a genetic susceptibility or a patient whose treatment was adversely affected by the failure to use new\ngenetic diagnostic techniques in a timely manner may bring a lawsuit against any number of entities across the\nPM lifecycle, including the physician who prescribed the drug, the drug manufacturer who produced the drug,\nthe manufacturer who developed the diagnostic test, the testing lab that conducted the test, the insurer which\nmay not have been willing to pay for a more appropriate genetic test, or the pharmacist that dispensed the\ndrug. If and when one or more lawsuits are successful, the dynamics of litigation generally are such that news\nof the successful litigation will spread quickly among the legal community, and the number of such cases\nbrought by trial attorneys will quickly skyrocket. If such a dynamic were to be unleashed in the context of PM,\nthe impacts would be enormous. Even a relatively low number of lawsuits would have pervasive effects on how\nPM is delivered and implemented, since the economic and psychological consequences of liability for any\nindividual at-risk party could be substantial.\nPhysicians are likely to be the most at risk for liability relating to PM, mostly because other parties will be\nprotected by various statutory and common law defenses such as the learned intermediary doctrine {Marchant\net al., 2011; Marchant et al., 2006). This is not just a hypothetical issue. There has already been a smattering\nof PM-related lawsuits filed against physicians, including: (1) failing to recommend a genetic test before\nprescribing a drug or treatment; (e.g. Downey v. Dunnington, 2008 — physician performed prophylactic\nmastectomy on woman based on her family history of breast cancer, but was sued for failing to test her for a\nBRCA mutation first); (2) failing to timely diagnose genetic condition, thereby leading to loss of chance to treat\n(e.g. Cardone v. Gunsberger, 2005 — physician liable for taking 3 weeks to diagnose a genetic disorder in an\ninfant); (3) failing to recognize that family history indicates need for a given diagnostic or screening test (e.g.\nBointy-Tsotigh v. U.S., 1996 — physician liable for not recommending early colonoscopy in patient with family\nhistory of cancer); (4) for providing an inaccurate diagnosis or prognosis based on genetic tests (e.g.,\nGallagher v. Duke University, 1988 — hospital erred in inaccurately reporting results of genetic tests to parents);\n(5) failure to warn family members about heritable conditions (e.g., Pafe v. Threikel, 1995 — doctor had duty to\nwarn daughter of his patient of genetic risk for cancer);\nThese initial cases are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg. As the scientific knowledge, regulatory approval,\nand commercial availability of pharmacogenomic tests continues to expand, the potential and likelihood for\nliability will likewise continue to grow, especially if physicians are resistant to the uptake of these new\ntechnologies and procedures. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty about the prospects of a medical\nmalpractice or other lawsuit brought by patients or other injured persons against their physician alleging that\ntheir injury was caused or exacerbated by the use or failure to employ PM technologies. The applicable legal\nscenarios, doctrines and evidentiary requirements relevant for PM liability for physicians are relatively\nuncharted, and are not fixed but rather are evolving due to shifting legal and policy trends. The first objective\nof this project will therefore be to identify and evaluate the relevant legal claims, defenses, and docirines that\nwill be applicable for potential liability lawsuits against physicians relating to PM, including recent doctrinal\nchanges and trends that will significantly affect the liability exposure of physicians.\nFor example, to bring a successful medical malpractice case against a physician, a plaintiff must show that (i)\nthe physician had a duly of care to the plaintiff, (ii) the physician breached that duty, (iii} the plaintiff incurred an\ninjury, and {iv) the physician’s breach caused the plaintiff's injury. The key element of liability exposure is the\nstandard of care, which is undergoing rapid and significant doctrinal changes (Gostin & Jacobson, 2006). In\nsome jurisdictions the standard of care is determined by local custom, and if few local physicians are currently\nusing PM tests, a physician who is sued for failing to use adequate methods will not be held to have viclated\nthe applicable standard of care. However, some jurisdictions apply a more objective “risk based” test to\n\nResearch Strategy Page 47\n"

          "text": "Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Gary\ndetermine the standard of care, where instead of looking to the common practices of the medical profession,\nthe court locks to whether the physician’s conduct was “reasonable” as determined by a judge or jury (Helling,\n1974; Peters, 2000}. Under this standard, a physician may be held liable even if the medical community at\nlarge has not yet adopted the PM test that a patient claims should have been used. Additionally, some\njurisdictions are now applying a national standard of care rather than a standard based on local practice and\ncustom (Lewis et al., 2007). These shifting definitions of the standard of care, along with new claims {e.g.,\ninformed consent) brought against physicians to skirt medical malpractice defenses, are likely to create\nuncertainty and substantially affect liability risks for physicians relating to PM (Marchant et al. 2006),\nThere are a number of other legal doctrinal trends and changes that will affect PM liability for physicians. New\ncauses of action beyond medical malpractice are emerging in the context of genetics and PM. For example,\nphysicians have been held liable in their handling of genetics by failing to obtain fully informed consent related\nto diagnostic and treatment procedures (Granata v. Fruiterman, 668 $.E.2d 127 (2008). These informed\nconsent claims are increasingly powerful tools for patients, especially as courts transition to a patient-centered\napproach to this doctrine, which requires physicians to disclose all information that reasonable patients would\nconsider material to their decision making (rather than the information that reasonable physicians would\nconsider material, as the traditional doctrine required). Physicians have also been sued for failure te disclose\ngenetic risks to family members of their patients who refuse to communicate the risk to their relatives, with\nmixed results (Pate v. Threlkel, 1995; Safer v. Pack, 1996; Molloy v. Meier, 2004). Other important doctrinal\nchanges, such as those adopted by courts or legislatures affecting “loss of chance” (King, 1981; Renehan,\n2009}, the learned intermediary doctrine (Calabro, 2004), and standards and procedures for medical\nmalpractice cases (Kachalia & Mello, 2011) will also impact significantly the liability potential for physicians in\nthe PM context.\n3. Liability Risks in Personalized Medicine\nWhile the number of lawsuits filed to date against physicians directly involving PM is limited, the number of\ncases will likely rise significantly in the next few years. However, little or no empirical analysis or in-depth\nresearch has been undertaken to date to try to evaluate the likelihood and magnitude of PM lawsuits being\nfiled, the likely outcome of those lawsuits, and the impact that such outcomes will have on physician practice\nand the implementation of PM. Some important lessons can likely be learned from previous litigation episodes\nand experiences involving previous medical technologies. A general trend has been that new technologies,\neven if they improve overall health care, lead to a significant bump up in liability as expectations are increased\nand the gap in performance widens between early and slow adopters (Sage, 2003; De Ville, 1998). Such a\ndynamic can be expected with PM.\nYet, there are reasons to believe that personalized medicine may present unique liability issues for physicians\ncompared to past medical technologies, although the project will seek to test this hypothesis. Reasons that\nPM may present unique liability dynamics include: (i) unlike other areas of medical practice where specialists\nwith training and experience in the relevant specialty are applying a new technology or procedure, PM will\ninvolve the application of genetic information by physicians in virtually every type of practice, most of whem\nhave no training or expertise in genetics; {ii) there are major uncertainties and disagreements within the\nmedical and scientific communities about the appropriate use of personalized medicine tests at this time\n(Burke et al., 2010), and such uncertainty is known to be a major factor increasing liability risks (Craswell &\nCalfee, 1986); and {ili) the rapid pace of technology change in the personalized medicine results in constantly\nchanging expectations and standards of care that can again greatly increase liability risk (SACGHS, 2008;\nMarchant et al., 2011).\nIn this present and unique environment, where much uncertainty exists about both the appropriate\nimplementation of PM and the risks associated with implementing or not implementing specific PM methads,\nthere is an important need for greater information and guidance on liability risks. Physicians, hospitals,\nmalpractice insurers, and other PM stakeholders will be making important decision that are currently based on\nincomplete or inaccurate impressions of their liability risks. Moreover, once liability has been established and\nstarts to snowball, it will be too late to take appropriate measures and safeguards to protect agains liability. At\nthis critical juncture in the rollout of PM, before widespread liability has taken hold, it would therefore be very\n\nResearch Strategy Page 48\n"

Because both the likelihood and outcome of PM\nlawsuits will be highly fact- and evidence-dependent, it will be necessary to evaluate liability risks in the context\nof specific examples in which the applicable legal and evidentiary information is assessed and integrated. This\nattempt to predict the risks of PM liability, integrating both legal doctrine and factual evidence, will be the\nsecond abjeciive of this proposal.\n4, is Liability A Problem?\nThe third objective of this project will be to anticipate the potential impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of\n| physician liability in the PM arena Personal injury liability, including liability for health care professionals, can\nserve an important social purpose to the extent that it induces actors to take appropriate actions to minimize\nunreasonable health risks (Gostin, 2000; Mello, 2006). If individuals are being harmed or denied the best\n| health care because of the unreasonable failure of physicians to take full advantage of PM knowledge and\ntechnologies, the threat of liability can be an important driver for implementing sooner and more widely such\nbeneficial personalized medicine technologies at the clinical level.\nOn the other hand, problems are created by the enormous, and inevitably growing, uncertainties about the\nliability risks relating to personalized medicine. This uncertainty is caused by a number of factors including the\nlack of existing legal precedents in this specific area, the diverse state laws for determining the applicable\nstandard of care, the lack of authoritative standards for practicing personalized medicine, the divergent expert\nopinions about the feasibility and effectiveness of existing PM tests, and the uncertainty about how lay jurors\nwill evaluate claims relating to genetic testing. These pervasive uncertainties about PM liability risks present\nseveral potential policy problems. First, physicians may engage in defensive medicine and over-utilize genetic\ntesting in order to protect against liability. Defensive medicine is defined generally as a deviation from sound\nmedical practice induced primarily by a threat of liability (OTA, 1994).\nA physician may practice defensive medicine by performing extra tests or procedures to minimize potential\nliability, hoping that the additional testing will reduce adverse medical outcomes, deter patients from filing\nmalpractice claims, and persuade the legal system that the appropriate standard of care was met. A number of\nstudies have suggested that many physicians practice defensive medicine by ordering more diagnostic tests\nthat would be warranted based on medical considerations alone (Studdert et al., 2005; Birbeck et al, 2004}.\nUncertainty about applicable legal standards tends to increase the practice of defensive medicine (Studdert et\nal., 2005; Fenn et al., 2004), The resulting unnecessary diagnostic tests impose a significant cost on the\nmedical system. The practice of defensive medicine has already been observed in the context of prenatal\ngenetic testing, for which some commentators have argued that legal standards have over-ridden medical\njudgment in determining when prenatal genetic tests are appropriate (Young, 2003; Howlett et al., 2002;\nAnnas, 1985). In addition, the potential is there for some tests to do more harm than good. FVL is an example.\nPatients and physicians may be compelled to take action (anticoagulation) that will result in more overall harm\n(bleeding complications) than benefit (clots prevented) because of not understanding the nature of absolute\nrisk versus relative risk.\nIn addition to creating pressures for practicing defensive medicine, the uncertainty about applicable liability\nstandards relating to PM will have other adverse effects. For example, the lack of any agreed standards for\nordering personalized medicine tests will results in different standards of care, with some physicians being\nmore proactive on ordering such tests and others being slower to adopt these new tools. Patients may thus be\nprovided with inconsistent care if decisions are being influenced by legal concerns on an ad hoc basis.\nGiven these potential counter-productive consequences from the uncertainties and risks of PM liability, itis not\ntoo early to begin considering policy options — at either the private or public levels — to address these\nproblems. Even less work has been done on solutions to the liability problem far PM than has been devoted to\n| identifying the risks of liability. The fourth objective of this project will be to identify potential policy initiatives to\nprovide greater certainty to PM actors and thus to reduce liability risks and uncertainties. Almost no work has\nbeen done on liability prevention in the PM context to date, but some of the ideas that will be explored include\nbetier business models to integrate drugs and companion diagnostic tests, clinical guidelines that recommend\nbest practices, better training of physicians and other health professionals, regulatory changes and other\nResearch Strategy Page 49\n"

For example, physicians, PM policymakers, medical guidelines writers,\nregulators, and medical educators need to have realistic expectations about the potential for liability in this\nsphere as PM emerges as the dominant medical model of this century. Patients, the group who will poteritially\nbring such lawsuits, and the stakeholders who could be most affected by both the beneficial and detrimental\npotential impacts of liability, need to be aware of liability issues and become proactive in the inevitable policy\nand legal baitles relating to liability. Finally, the practitioners in the legal liability field, including lawyers, expert\nwitnesses and judges, also would benefit from clear and informative information about liability. Thus, the fifth\nobjective of ihe proposal will be to conduct outreach on the findings of this project to key stakeholder groups\nincluding physicians, patient groups and legal practitioners.\nll. Innovation\nMuch research has been done on the scientific, medical, regulatory, economic, educational, intellectual\nproperty, ethical and public policy aspects of personalized medicine. In contrast, very little doctrinal, empirical\nor theoretical work has been done on the issue of liability in the PM field, notwithstanding frequent references\n| to the importance of the issue for PM (e.g., SACGHS, 2008, p. 47; Sorrel, 2008, NRC, 2007). Only a handful of\nshort, preliminary analyses emphasizing the potential importance of this subject have been published to date\n| (Marchant, 2011; Roth, 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Evans, 2007; Rothstein, 2005; Osscrio, 2001}. The risks,\nrelevant key factors, impacts, and possible solutions relating to potential PM liability are largely unknown and\nhave been under-studied to date. There is much that could be done to provide beneficial further information,\ntrends, predictions, and proposed policy interventions to address this largely uncharted subjected that ts likely\nto play a critical role in the implementation of PM over the next decade. The knowledge generated by research\n| on these issues would likely prove very useful in helping physicians, patient groups, legal practitioners and\nother various stakeholders in PM to make informed decisions relating to the risks and prevention of liability.\nThe present proposal therefore addresses a conspicuous gap in the knowledge base and available literature\non PM. To fill this gap, it is important to not anly have a good knowledge of law and legal research, but also of\nthe scientific, medical, economic, and policy dimensions of PM, because these integrate with the law in\nunderstanding, predicting and preventing liability. In this proposal, we have attempted to address the need for\nsuch an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach in two innovative ways. First, the research team\nincorporates a broad range of relevant training, experience and expertise necessary to address the multi-\ndimensional and complex issues of PM liability. The Pl (Gary Marchant) is trained as both a geneticist and\nlawyer, and has worked on liability issues relating to genetics for the past decade, including publishing\nnumerous articles on such issues and serving as lead organizer of three previous conferences and workshops\non genetics liability issues. Co-Investigator Doug Campos-Outcalt is a medical schoo] professor involved in\ntraining future physicians and who has worked and written on physician uptake of PM genetic tests, and has\nserved on the CDC’s EGAPP (Evidence based Genomics Applied in Practice and Prevention) group evaluating\nthe clinical readiness of PM tests. Co-Investigator Amalia Issa is a scientist whose work focuses on how PM\napplications will be translated and integrated into clinical practice, health care delivery and health systems,\nincluding studying physician and patient perspectives on PM uptake. Consultant Scott Ramsey is a physician\nand health economist whose work examines economic factors affecting clinical uptake of new medical\ntechnologies and procedures. Consultant Paul Wicks is Director of Research and Development at\nPatientsLikeMe and works on new approaches and models for patient participation and engagement in their\nown healthcare. Consultant Rachel Lindor is a lawyer currently completing her MD training at Mayo Medical\nSchool who has conducted research on medical liability and reimbursement issues relating to PM, including a\nposter presentation on liability issues relating to PM at this year’s American Society for Clinical Oncology\nannual conference.\nSecond, we plan to directly engage key stakeholders in the project through our consultants and supporters on\nthe project and using our extensive existing network of contacts in the PM field.

Research Approach\nThis project will proceed in three steps, roughly segmented by the three years of the proposal. The first year\nwill be devoted to identifying relevant legal doctrine, including potential claims, criteria, and defenses for the\nwide variety of liability lawsuits that might be anticipated against physicians related to PM lifecycle.. In the\nsecond year, we will assess the risk of liability for physicians relating to PM, by integrating the doctrinal\nanalysis with the specific factual and evidentiary data for four PM case studies. We will also look to previous\nexamples of physician liability relating to new medical technologies for relevant lessons and projections for PM.\nFinally, in the third year, we will address two objectives. First, we will investigate impacts of liability on\nphysicians, patients and society more generally as well explore possible policy options for addressing the\npotential liability risks and uncertainties relating to PM. Second, we will adapt and customize our findings for\nrelevant stakeholders groups and undertake outreach on our findings to those sectors, including physicians,\npatient groups, medical educators, and malpractice insurers.\n| Year One: identifying Liability Claims and Doctrine\nThe first year will invelve identifying and assessing the applicable Jegal claims and doctrines that may be\napplicable to PM lawsuits against physicians. As discussed above, the legal landscape applicable to such\nlawsuits has been undergoing significant change in recent years, with major potential implications for the\nchances of PM lawsuits against physicians being filed and succeeding. The first year of the project will be\ndevoted to a comprehensive scoping of the legal landscape for PM liability of physicians. This work will include\ntwo lines of research.\nThe first line of research will be to identify, analyze and catalogue every reported case in the United States in\nwhich a physician was sued relating to PM or genetic testing in other medical contexts (e.g., prenatal genetic\ntesting). We anticipate finding 100-200 relevant judicial decisions. For each case, we will identify the relevant\nlegal claims brought against the physician, as well as the outcome of the case and the key factual evidence,\nexpert opinions, reliance on authoritative statements or professional guidelines, defenses, or other factors that\nled to the outcome. In addition to looking at the reported decision, we will also review court filings and briefs\nand expert opinions filed in significant cases when accessible. From this data set, we will distill some overall\nfindings as to the range and dimensions of possible legal claims that could be brought against physicians in the\nPM context and the key factors likely to determine the outcome of those claims based on the historical legal\nprecedents. The list and characterization of cases will be posted on a public website created to communicate\nthe results of this project.\n| The second line of research in year one will be to evaluate some of the key legal doctrinal issues that are likely\nto affect liability relating to PM. PM liability risks will be dependent on some key legal doctrines that are\ncurrently evolving and are in flux, including:\na. Sfandard of care for medical malpractice: Medical malpractice is based on whether a physician\nbreached the applicable standard for care. As discussed in more detail above, the standard of care for\nphysicians is currently undergoing significant change. The standard of care has traditionally been\ndefined by custom in the locality in which the physician practices, but in many jurisdictions the standard\nhas been evolving from a local to a national standard, and from a duty based on custom to a more\nobjective standard. These and other changes in how the standard of care is defined are likely to have\nsignificant impacts on PM liability risks for physicians (Lewis et al., 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Peiers,\n2000}. Moreover, important legislative and policy initiatives relating to medical malpractice are being\nimplemented or considered across the nation (Kachalia & Mello, 2011), and these too cauld\nsignificantly affect the prospects for PM physician liability.\nb. Learned intermediary doctrine - The learned intermediary doctrine shifts responsibility (and\nassociated liability) for failure to warn a patient from a drug or device manufacturer to the prescribing\nphysician if the manufacturer included an appropriate warning in the praduct materials received by the\nphysician (i.e., patient package insert for a pharmaceutical), The applicability and scope of this doctrine\nis currently being challenged, with two states (New Jersey and W. Virginia) recently deciding ta no\nlonger recognize the defense, a trend which if it continues could have major implications for PM liability\nResearch Strategy Page 51\n"

          "text": "Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Gary\n(Perez, 1999; Calabro, 2004).\nc. Role of clinical guidelines — Various organizations have produced clinical guidelines to attempt to\nguide health care professionals to make appropriate clinical decisions. The role that such clinical\nguidelines should play in defining the standard of care in a medical malpractice case is still evolving.\nThe role and weight that judges and juries extend to clinical guidelines in medical malpractice cases will\npotentially play an important role in determining PM liability risks (SCGHS8, 2008; Evans, 2006).\nd. Loss of chance — In most PM liability cases, a physician’s negligence will not “cause” the plainttif’s\ninjury, which will often be pre-existing to the doctor's treatment (e.g., cancer or cancer predisposition).\nRather than causing the plaintiff's illness, the physician’s actions may have reduced the probability that\nthe plaintiff might have been successfully treated. Notwithstanding the lack of causation per se, courts\nhave gradually permitted recovery for the “loss of a chance” of survival under certain circurnstances\n(King 1981}. The recognition and criteria for allowing a plaintiff to receive compensation for loss of\nchance have been evolving in recent years (Renehan, 2009), and the availability and scope of this\ncause of action will be critical to the viability of many potential PM lawsuits.\nThe shifting status, application and criteria for these important legal doctrines affecting potential PM lawsuits\nwill be analyzed through a review of key court decisions and secondary materials. The results of this doctrinal\nanalysis will be integrated with the case law analysis and will be published in one or more journal manuscripts\nprepared at the end of year one of the project.\n| Year Two: Evaluating PM Liability Risks\nAs discussed above, there has been no in-depth research or analysis on the level of risk that physicians are\nlikely to face in the PM context — in terms of both the likelihood of facing a lawsuit and the probable outcome of\nsuch lawsuits. In the second year of the project, we will undertake two projects to help elucidate the risks of\nliability and the key factors influencing such risks. The first task will analyze previous lawsuits against\nphysicians relating to their failure to use, premature use, or faulty use of new medical technologies. We will\nexamine the results and important factors in individual lawsuits, as well as the dynamics of the litigation relating\nto that technology as a class. In reviewing individual cases, we will evaluate why physicians were held liable in\nsome cases and not in others, discerning the key factors, evidence and legal rules that influenced the\noutcome. In looking at classes at cases, we will seek fo understand the dynamics of the litigation,\ninvestigating such questions as; What was the time line of the cases? How did a positive or negative outcome\nfor the plaintiff affect the rate of new cases against that same technology? Were the cases brought by the\nsame plaintiffs’ lawyers, or were there a variety of lawyers? These types of trends can help provide insights on\nthe dynamics of litigation — for example, is there likely to be a steady trickle of such cases, or will the cases\ncome in clusters or bursts of lawsuits?\nIn choosing and undertaking this analysis of other litigation against physicians for their utilization (or lack\nthereof) of new medical technologies, we will start our research with some major secondary sources on the\nissue of technology and medical malpractice litigation (e.g., Sage, 2003; De Ville, 1998) to help us identify the\nmost promising and informative technology precedents to analyze in depth. We will then pick 3-5 medical\ntechnologies that have been the subject of significant litigation against physicians and collect and analyze the\nprimary cases involving those technologies. The chjective will be to draw lessons from these previous\nexamples (recognizing and addressing the various ways that PM litigation may differ because of its\nuniqueness) about the risks and dynamics of such litigation. In addition to this broader question, this\ncomparative and historical analysis will enable us to focus in on specific factors that might affect liability. For\nexample, one question that will be pursued is what impact does decisions by CMS and private insurers to\ncover or not cover a specific technology or procedure affect the potential liability of physicians with respect to\ntheir use (or non-use) of that technology or procedure (the difficulty in obtaining reimbursement for many\ngenetic tests currently is an important impediment to the uptake of PM by physicians). We will publish our\nfindings on the more general trends as well as specific factors that can affect liability (e.g., insurance coverage}\nin an academic journal.\nThe second task will be to look at four case studies involving different uses of PM technologies te evaluate the\nResearch Strategy Page 52\n"

The risk of liability will depend in significant part on the factual and\n\nscientific evidence about the effectiveness, safety, clinical utility and cost of the specific tests that the plaintiff\n\nalleges the physician failed to use, used prematurely, or used incorrectly, combined with the applicable legal\n\ndoctrines discussed above. Because liability risks will be fact- and context-specific, the risks can best be\n\nevaluated by using case studies to assess the potential for liability in specific contexts. We have identified the\n\nfollowing four case studies to evaluate, each involving a different type of PM test:\na. Warfarin (Coumadin): Warfarin is one of the most discussed drugs with respect to whether\nphysicians should require a genetic test before prescribing the drug {Wadelius & Pirmohamed, 2007}.\nWarfarin has a very narrow therapeutic index and the safe dose for an individual patient can vary based\non a number of factors including polymorphisms in two genes (CYP2C9 and VKORC), If the initial dose\nis too high for the individual patient, a serious bleeding event can result. The FDA revised the label for\nwarfarin in 2007 {and again in 2009) to give greater emphasis to the potential benefits of genetic testing\nfor initial dose determination, and a number of experts and organizations (e.g., CMS, Mayo/Medcc)\nhave offered inconsistent opinions on whether genetic testing is warranted {Epstein et al., 2010; Lenzini\net al. 2010; Kamali & Wynne, 2010; CMS, 2009; Roth, 2009). A number of other studies are underway,\nincluding randemized clinical trials, so the evidentiary support for genetic testing may change over time.\nThe case for genetic testing prior to prescribing warfarin therefore remains uncertain and contested.\nThis case study will evaluate whether a physician who fails to genetically test a patient prior to\nprescribing warfarin might be held liable if that patient suffers a serious or fatal reaction as a result of\nthe failure to recommend genetic testing prior to initial dosing.\nb. Gene expression diagnostic tests — A variety of diagnostic products using gene expression assays\nare available or being developed to profile tumors or infectious disease agents to predict prognosis or\nrisk of recurrence. For example, the Oncotype Dx® diagnostic test used gene expression analysis to\npredict the risk of recurrence of breast cancer, which can then be used to make decisions about\nwhether procedures such as chemotherapy are necessary {Snoo et al., 2009; EGAPP, 2009; Satiriou &\nPusztai, 2009). It is possible that a physician could be sued either for using the test prematurely (before\nits use had been validated) or for not using the test at all.\nc. BRCA testing - Among the strongest and best validated disease predisposition genes are the\nBRCA1/2 genes for breast cancer, as women carrying a mutation in either of these genes have a 50-85\npercent risk of breast or ovarian cancer (Robson & Offit, 2007). Interventions such as prophylactic\nbilateral radical mastectomies and oophorectomies have been shown to substantially reduce the risk of\ncancer in asymptomatic women carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation (Robson & Offit, 2007). Various expert\nevidentiary reviews have recommended genetic testing of women who have certain risk factors for\ncarrying one of these mutations, such as having two first-degree female relatives who have developed\nbreast cancer. A physician could potentially be sued if he or she sees an asymptomatic patient with a\nstrong family history of breast cancer, but dees not recommend the patient undergo genetic counseling\nor BRCA testing. If that patient subsequently develops breast cancer, she or her surviving family\nmembers could bring a lawsuit alleging that the physician breached a duty to warn her of her potential\ngenetic risk, and the failure to recommend genetic testing resulted in the patient’s “loss of chance” to\nhave prevented or successfully treated the disease.\nd. Whole Genome Sequencing: The final case study involves a very recent type of genetic testing that\nis only in early research stages at this time but could become part of clinical care relatively quickly in at\nleast some practices. The potential for rapid adoption of whole genome sequencing may fuel a\ndiscrepancy in care that could leave slower adopter physicians and provider institutions at risk of\nliability. This technique is already being used in the research context, for example, to sequence the\nentire genome of a cancer patient's tumor and compare it to that same patient’s inherited genome\n(Boneita, 2010; Ormend, et al., 2007). Genetic changes revealed in tumors using this comparative\napproach could be used to identify otherwise unexpected treatment regimes that target the particular\nmolecular identity of the tumor. Although this method has only been used in research studies on a\nrelatively small number of patients to date, the results today are promising and have generated\nsignificant interest in the method. While the technique is too expensive and experimental to be used in\nroutine cancer care now, leading institutions and physicians may adopt the technology on selected\n\nResearch Strategy Page 53\n"

As will be the case for any new, expensive, and highly technical\nnew medical procedure, a gap is likely to quickly grow between those providers at the leading edge of\ntechnology and care, and those that lack the resources, expertise, and wherewithal to keep up with the\nleaders in the field or those physicians who are more cautious about adopting new technologies until\nthey have a proven track record. Especially as more and more jurisdictions migrate to a national rather\nthan local standard of care, this growing discrepancy between the leaders and the slow adopiers\ncreates an opening for litigation and liability (Lewis, et al., 2007).\n\nSlow adopters of whole-genome sequencing and related genetic technologies may face liability\nrisk in a number of different scenarios. For example, tissue from the tumor of a patient who succumbed\nto cancer at a local hospital may be sent to a leading laboratory conducting a cancer genetics research\nproject, where it might be discovered that the tumor had a specific mutation that had been successfully\ntargeted by therapies given to cancer patients at a different hospital, where their tumors had been\nanalyzed using whole genome sequencing. In this situation, the family of the deceased patient may be\nable to bring a lawsuit alleging that the treating physician and hospital had failed to apply the\nappropriate standard of care in net conducting whole genome sequencing of their family member.\nAnother possibility is that a family member of the deceased patient whose genome was sequenced\nmay subsequently develop a cancer and allege that the physician should have identified a cancer-\npredisposing mutation in the deceased patient and warned other family members that they may carry\nthe same risky mutation (Pate v. Threlkel, 1995; Safer v. Pack, 1996; Molloy v. Meier, 2004),\n\nIn evaluating these four case studies, we will seek to identify those legal or factual variables that increase or\ndecrease the likelihood of liability, recognizing that the ultimate resolution of any individual case will likely be\naffected by the vagaries of the individual attorneys, experts, jury members and judge involved in that case.\nThus, any absolute or certain prediction of risk is not possible. What will be possible, however, and will be the\noutput of this project will be to identify fact patterns and variable that will make a physician’s employment of a\nparticular PM test or procedure more or less prone to liability, as well as some qualitative observations and\npredictions about the frequency and cutcomes of such liability generally. We will summarize this analyze in a\npublished manuscript. We will also post the four case studies and supporting materials on the public project\nwebsite.\n| Year Three: impacts, Solutions and Outreach\n\nIn the third year, we will wrap up the project by exploring the likely impacts on physicians and patients of the\nliabilities and liability risks identified and characterized in the first two years of the project as well as the\nbroader societal implications of such liability, and also seek to identify possible policy interventions and other\nsolutions that can help reduce uncertainties about the risks of liability relating to PM. We will also use the third\nyear of our project to communicate the findings of our project to relevant stakeholders and other interested\nparties.\n\nThe potential impacts of liabilities and liability risks imposed on physicians will necessarily be conjectural\nduring the course of this study, since we are anticipating liability trends for the next decade or so that will only\nbe starting to occur during the course of this study. Nevertheless, examining previous legal precedents and\neconomic studies of physician response to other sources of liability (e.g., defensive medicine}, we will develop\nsome possible projections of how physicians will be impacted by different liability scenarios and risks relating to\nPM. The other major stakeholder group we will examine the impact on is patients. As discussed above,\nphysician liability relating to PM could have both positive and negative impacts (ar both) on patients, potentially\naffecting the safely, availability and cost of PM tests. Again, this analysis will be somewhat conjectural, but will\ndraw on extrapolations from legal and economic analyses of medical liability as they apply to patient well-being\nas we]] as the liability risk analyses from year two, to project potential outcomes both in terms of the health and\nwelfare of individual patients as well as broader population and distributional justice impacts (Issa et al., 2009}.\nWe will publish our overall findings on the impacts of PM liability for physicians in a wrap-up paper co-authored\nby all the investigators and consultants that provides our best informed assessment based on the various study\nresults about how such liability is expected to impact the uptake and development of PM, while also examining\nother broader questions such as the social justice implications relating to effects on access and availability of\n\nResearch Strategy Page 54\n"

This wrap-up paper will also summarize the lessons we can draw from PM liability for liability relating\nto other emerging medical technologies such as regenerative medicine, nanomedicine and human genetic\nengineering.\nThis liability impact analysis will then set up and feed into a study of potential policy solutions to address any\nnegative impacts predicted from PM liability on physicians, patients or other stakeholders. Sorne of the policy\nsolutions we will evaluate include greater use of and protection provided by clinical guidelines, better training of\nphysicians and other health professionals, increased patient awareness and participation, regulatory and\ndoctrinal change to malpractice standards or other applicable legal provisions, judicial and other courtroom\nreforms, and other possible solutions. There is almost no existing analysis of such policy responses to reduce\nliability relating to PM, so this analysis will be breaking new ground. The goals will be to identify and assess\noptions that increase informed decision-making by participants in the medical and liability communities,\nincluding physicians, patients, judges and lawyers, as well as mechanisms for reducing uncertainties and\nproviding greater predictability of expectations.\nRelating to this emphasis, the final objective of our project will be to communicate the findings of our analysis\nand to provide guidance to relevant stakeholders, including particularly physicians and patients, and legal\npractitioners on how they might use our analysis to better understand how PM liability may affect them and\nhow they might mitigate or prevent such impacts. We will communicate our results through three primary\nchannels. First, our research, analysis and recommendations will be published in a series of academic articles\nas discussed above, with many of our detailed analyses and data sets posted on a publicly available project\nwebsite to be hosted by the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law. Second, we will produce and make\navailable electronically 4-page briefing papers that summarize our analyses and distill the key findings,\nimplications and recommendations of the project that are specifically adapted and focused on a key\nstakeholder for each briefing paper. We will produce one briefing paper for physicians, one for patients, and\none for lawyers and judges.\nFinally, we will conduct an outreach campaign with affected stakeholders to communicate our findings and\nrecommendations to key stakeholders, including physician groups, patient groups, medical educators, and\nmalpractice insurers. We have attached a letter of support from a representative organization from each of\nthese stakeholder groups (see attached letters from Maricopa County Medical Society (physicians),\nPatientsLikeMe (patients), Mayo Medical School (medical educators), and the Mutual Insurance Company of\nArizona (physician malpractice insurers}). Each of these organizations is interested in having us communicate\nthe findings of our research to their organizations and members, and to assist us in our outreach to similar\norganizations across the country.\nIn conclusion, many studies and analyses have referred to the potential importance of liability to the roll-out\nand uptake of PM (e.g., SACGHS, 2008, p. 92; NRC, 2007). Yet, very little empirical, doctrinal or theoretic\nresearch has been conducted to date to explore the nature and likelihood of liability affecting PM. By focusing\nhere on the liability of the physician, the most legally vulnerable player in the PM lifecycle and a key\ngatekeeper for the use of PM, we hope and expect to make an important contribution fer policymakers,\nstakeholders and other interested parties concerned with the near-future development of PM.\nLeadership Plan\nPI Gary Marchant will have overall responsibility for the project. He and Co-Investigators Amalia Issa and Doug\nCampos-Outcalt will divide responsibility for the genetic case law and doctrinal analysis in year one (with\nresearch assistance from student workers), and the four PM case studies in year two. J.D./M.D. graduate\nstudent Rachel Lindor will undertake the historical analysis of physician liability from other technologies under\nthe supervision of P] Marchant and in collaboration with Co-Investigator Issa and her research team. Co-\nInvestigator Campos-Outcalt will focus his efforts in year two on the four case studies. All three primary\ninvestigators, along with consultants Ramsey and Wicks, will work together in year three for the impact\nanalysis, development of potential policy solutions, and stakeholder outreach. All members of the research\nteam will participate in periodic conference calls to discuss recent findings and their implications.\n\nResearch Strategy Page 55\n"
