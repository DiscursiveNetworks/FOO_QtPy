Doctoral Dissertation and Research Experience\n\nMy research interests in understanding the aging process and improving the quality of life for older adults\nwere first developed in the three-year research assistant experience in the lab of aging and cognition at Zhejiang\nUniversity. | applied for the Zhejiang Province Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fellowship and\nwas funded to test the reliability and feasibility of using an internet administered 9-item Patient Health\nQuestionnaire (PHQ-9) as a depression screening tool for Chinese older adults. Furthermore, we developed a\ncellphone application, integrating the function of self-diagnosis, mood monitoring, and online intervention\nmaterials. The mobile app encompasses Problem Solving Therapy courses filmed by our team to improve\npatients’ access to therapy resources. | was drawn to explore the potentials of employing information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) to improve older adults’ quality of lives through the first experience of using\nmobile technology to deliver mental health services. This research experience produced a paper published in\nAsia-Pacific Psychiatry.\n\nAs a first-generation college student at Zhejiang University, | seized as many opportunities to get research\ntraining as | possibly could. | found gratification in building new knowledge and was fascinated by the possibilities\nin making positive change using research. | visited the University of Surabaya to collaborate with researchers in\nIndonesia to conduct cross-culture research. | worked with Dr. Christ Mayhorn on the topic of evaluating the\nsocial engineering of phishing attacks at North Carolina State University. | was selected as one of the three\nundergraduates at Zhejiang University to work as a paid research intern at the University of Alberta at the School\nof Nursing. During the three-months internship, | worked with Drs. Carole Estabrooks and Matthias Hoben on\nthe Translating Research in Elder Care program. | studied how does the working environments of nursing homes\naffect the physical and mental health of its employees. | also participated in a systematic review on the topic of\nthe barriers and facilitators of oral health care for older adults residing in nursing homes, which was published in\nthe International Journal of Nursing Studies. My experiences at multiple cities in China, Indonesia, Canada, and\nthe United States exposed me to the rich cultures at diverse regions of the world, which inspires and empowers\nme to research with populations with diverse backgrounds. Through working on aging-related research topics, |\nrealized the vast unmet needs in research and practice with the older adult population in my China and globally.\n| decided to commit my research to this vulnerable group with complex challenges.\n\nBy the end of my undergraduate training, | had a strong aspire and a clear vision of becoming an investigator\nin applied science. Therefore, | applied for the MSW/PhD dual degree program at the University of Southern\nCalifornia Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work (USC SSW). Located in central Los Angeles, USC\nprovides a unique research environment for studying older adults with diverse cultural backgrounds and linguistic\npreferences. Driven by my interest in employing technology to improve older adults’ health outcomes, |\nparticipated in the Intergenerational Mobile Technology Opportunities Program (IMTOP) led by Drs. Shinyi Wu\nand Iris Chi. The Intergenerational Mobile Technology Opportunities Program (IMTOP) is a mHealth intervention\nthat recruited college-student tutors to help older patients to learn how to use mobile technology and a health\ntracking app to facilitate diabetes self-management. Using the data collected in the IMTOP intervention study,\nmy first-authored paper reporting the longitudinal IMTOP intervention effects in rural Taiwan won the 2018 APHA\nNobuo Maeda International Research Award. The manuscript was submitted to The Diabetes Educator and is\ncurrently under review. Additionally, | presented more results from the IMTOP study at annual scientific meetings\nof the Society of Social Work and Research and Gerontological Society of America. The hands-on research\nactivities conducted with IMTOP not only helped me learn substantial knowledge in designing and implementing\nmobile health (mHealth) interventions but also gained excellent training in theoretical thinking and scientific\nwriting. Furthermore, IMTOP study leads to two more research opportunities in which | contributed significantly\n— IMTOP pilot study for immigrant populations in Los Angeles and a feasibility study of an intergenerational\nmHealth program for affordable housing communities (IMPAHC) in Sacramento.\n\nEncouraged by the promising intervention effects found in Taiwan, we decided to adapt the IMTOP\nintervention to meet type 2 diabetes management needs for immigrants in Los Angeles. I led [MTOP pilot study\nto test the feasibility of using the technology-facilitated diabetes self-management intervention to address the\nprevalent problem of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among first generation Chinese and Hispanic immigrants. The\nresearch project adopts a mixed-method approach, using both survey and individual semi-structured interviews\nto collect data. The research project is a collaboration between USC Edward R. Roybal Institute on Aging and\nfour community-based organizations serving recent Chinese and Hispanic immigrants. | paid weekly visits to all\nfour community collaborators and communicated with managers and staff members of the organizations to\nformulate our research plan. | supervised 3 MSW students and one undergraduate student and provided training\nin qualitative research methods and questionnaire administration.

Because of this pilot study, | had the opportunity to\nwork closely with community-based organizations and gained experience in data collection and research\nprogram management. The IMTOP pilot study yields two manuscripts under preparation.\n\nThe results of the IMTOP pilot study highlighted the importance of social, cultural environments on health\noutcomes. Collaborating with community-based organizations significantly increased our access to the target\npopulation of the intervention and provided future avenues for disseminating the research results. Employing\nwhat we learned in both [MTOP and IMTOP pilot study, Dr. Wu, Dr. Chi, and | submitted a proposal to the USC\nSSW Adult Mental Health and Well-being (AMHW) department and were awarded a pilot funding for exploring\nthe feasibility of delivering a mobile health facilitated T2D intervention at affordable retirement communities\n(ImPAHC). I served as a co-investigator on the ImPAHC study. We paid visits to three retirement communities\nand conducted semi-structured interviews with professionals and staff and had focus group discussions with\nolder adult residents. | am working with two other graduate students to analyze the qualitative data with thematic\ncontent analysis methods. Working with retirement housing communities inspires me to investigate the aging\nprocess and social determinants of health through the lenses of ecological theory, which leads to my decision of\ninvestigating the physical and social environments in my dissertation research.\n\nBesides research opportunities provided in the doctoral program, the MSW training of the dual degree\nprogram provided opportunities for me to gain clinical practice experience and work directly with older adults in\nmy field placement. [ interned at ABC Adult Day Health Care Center for 20+ hours per week during my first year\nin the MSW/PhD dual degree program. In my clinical practice, | witnessed the prevalent loneliness and social\nisolation among seniors and observed the strong wishes of older adults in getting connected with family and\nfriends. Social isolation and loneliness have become the primary outcomes in my research since then. Many\nolder adults came to consult me on how to use their mobile phones to contact friends and sharing meaningful\nmemories online with their families. My experience working closely with older adults affirm the value of\naddressing social isolation by bringing information technology to older adult’s life.\n\nMy clinical practice and research experiences made me aware that the majority of the currently available\ntechnology tools, such as social media sites, mobile health apps, are not designed with older adults’ unique\nneeds in mind. Older people often are not included as part of the intervention/technological tool development\nteam, which adds barriers for older people to learn to use technology. To address this issue, | serve as a co-\ninvestigator on a research project, led by Drs. Wu and Chi, employing a participatory co-design approach to\ndevelop a caregiver self-management program (CSMP) app for the Chinese immigrant caregivers of older adults.\nThe co-design CSMP app proposal was funded by the USC Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)\nand AMHW pilot awards. We have completed the conceptual design, interactive prototype testing, and internal\nreal-life condition testing phases of the co-design process. | am currently working with a graduate student\ncolleague to conduct qualitative data analysis and drafting the manuscript reporting the unique needs of the\nChinese immigrant caregiver population and their acceptance of technology-facilitated interventions. The CSMP\napp co-design study preliminarily supported the feasibility of delivering a traditional in-person intervention with a\nmobile technology platform. | also gained first-hand experience using the co-design process for intervention tool\ndevelopment and pilot research.\n\n| pursued my interest in studying social isolation and loneliness in directed research tutorials and my qualifying\nexam project. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), | exanimated the longitudinal association\nbetween internet use and loneliness for older people. The manuscript prepared with this work is currently in\nrevision and resubmission. Because of my strong interests in statistical methodology, | sought training in\nstructural equation modeling (SEM) and longitudinal data modeling at the Inter-university Consortium for Political\nand Social Research (ICPSR) summer training at the University of Michigan. Learning advanced statistical\nmethodology enabled me to model the relationships of key variables of interests in a sophisticated manner. |\nfurther horned my data management and modeling skills in the process of conducting independent research with\nthe qualifying exam. The qualifying exam project examined the longitudinal bidirectional relationship between\nthe accumulation of geriatric conditions and loneliness. The study results were rich enough to be reported in two\nseparate manuscripts that will be submitted to top gerontology journals.\n\nSocially isolated older adults are at high risk of cognitive decline and the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and\nrelated dementias (ADRD). My past research experiences shaped the path for me to study the longitudinal\nassociation between environmental factors, social isolation, and cognitive health.

Training Goals and Objectives\n\nMy research is guided by the overarching goal of promoting long, healthy, and meaningful lives. My long-term\ncareer development objective is to build substantial knowledge that leads to effective interventions from a social-\necological/community engagement perspective to reduce social isolation and prevent cognitive decline. |\nenvision myself to be a leading scientist in a renowned research-oriented university and making impacts with my\nresearch on social isolation and cognitive health. For the F99/K00 award tenure, | aspire to gain knowledge in\ncognitive health and ADRD research, receive training in analyzing high-frequency digital biomarkers longitudinal\ndata and neuroimaging methodologies, and expand experience in intervention development, implementation,\nand assessment. Working with my sponsors, | developed the following specific training goals and objectives and\ndescried how we plan to collaborate to achieve the training goals.\n\nTraining Goal 1: increase knowledge in prevention, intervention, and policy pertaining to cognitive\ndecline in normal aging and the development of ADRD. [ will work with my co-sponsors, Dr. Iris Chi, Dr.\nShinyi Wu, and Dr. Hiroko Dodge, to get immersed in cognitive health research. | will systematically learn the\nprotective and risk factors of cognitive decline, currently available treatment, and interventions for ADRD through\nmentored research. | have already been actively engaged in the academic activities at the USC Edward R.\nRoybal Institute on Aging and have been attending research meetings where frontier aging and ADRD related\nresearch findings are presented. With the receipt of the F99/KOO, | will get involved with the Alzheimer's Disease\nResearch Center (ADRC) at USC and the Layton Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease Center at Oregon Health and\nScience University (OADC). Dr. Wu will help me to get connected with researchers at USC ADRC. | will learn\nnew progress in ADRD research by getting engaged with USC ADRC and building collaborative relationships for\nfuture research. Dr. Dodge will be the liaison for the resources at OADC, directing me to the personals and\nresearch cores according to my learning needs. Dr. Dodge and Dr. Wu will provide directed reading to facilitate\nmy learning for substantial topics related to cognitive decline and ADRD. | will present and discuss the papers\nwith peers and mentors in our regular journal club hosted by Dr. Wu. Additionally, [ will join through Zoom the\nmonthly OADC investigator meeting held at OHSU where researchers present to critique their ongoing research\nand proposals. [ plan to take a course at the USC School of Gerontology dedicated to discussing special issues\non cognitive decline and ADRD. This course covers cognitive decline for people with Alzheimer’s Disease or\n\nThe new knowledge in\ncognitive health gained through the F99 phase will enable me to conduct informed cutting-edge research at the\nKOO phase and beyond.\n\nTraining Goal 2: gain skills in analyzing high-frequency digital biomarkers longitudinal data and\nemploying neuroimaging methods. Through conducting research with the IMTOP study data, | had some\nexperience in utilizing biomarker measures, such as blood pressure and blood glucose, yet | have not\nsystematically learned about assessing and analyzing biomarker data in ADRD related research. Cognitive\nhealth studies often require the use of bio-marker indicators to objectively evaluate the intervention effect or\nlongitudinal changes in brain functioning. Neuroimaging methodology is widely used in ADRD related research,\nwhich allows the researchers to link the variation observed in behavioral testing of cognition with activities in the\nbrain. Learning to assess biomarkers as key variables in my research and using neuroimaging methods will\nenable me to have in-depth discussions with a broader scientific audience, including but not limited to\nresearchers in fields of Social Work, Neurology, Gerontology, and Engineering. Using biomarker and\nneuroimaging methodology will also equip me to build knowledge on detecting early-stage brain changes related\nto cognitive decline, which can produce scientific evidence that informs social work intervention and practice with\nthe socially isolated older adults. | plan to receive training conduct hands-on research in Neuroimaging methods\nin the KOO stage, at the OADC Neuroimaging core. The OADC is also specialized in collecting digital bio-marker\ndata. Digital biomarkers are collected using wearable devices in a nonintrusive manner, such as walking speed\nassessed using in-home sensors. Enhancing my capacity of understanding and using digital biomarker data will\nexpand the spectrum of outcomes | can investigate, including those indicators that are essential for ADRD\nresearch.\n\n[ will horn my longitudinal data analysis skills in the process of analyzing four waves of longitudinal data from\nthe NHATS study, which prepares me to analyze high-frequency digital biomarker longitudinal data in the KOO\nphase. I will complete a self-directed course on using R programming to handle large longitudinal datasets and\nrun sophisticated models that is suitable for answering my research questions, such as multi-level modeling,\nstructural equation modeling, and Bayesian inference models.\n\nApplicant's Background and Goals for Fellowship Training Page 52\n"

The potential causes of\nsocial isolation are multi-faceted. While the existing literature studied individual-level factors that were associated\nwith social isolation, such as age, *\"’, personality '*\"'” and health status, '**' only a few studies have examined\nthe extent to which the living environment influences the experience of social isolation among older adults.\n\nThe Ecological Theory of Aging (ETA) posits that the living environment profoundly influences the aging\nprocess.””** The process of personal and environmental resource exchange determines the aging outcomes\nthrough building their identity, evoking or reducing stress, and maintaining or hindering the autonomy of an older\nperson.” Environments not only affect social well-being of older adults, but it also serves as one of the most\npervasive and complex stimuli to the brain and contribute to shaping cognitive functionality through the\nmechanism of neuroplasticity.* Socially isolated individuals are at higher risk of cognitive decline.”*”* Social\nisolation might mediate the association between environments and cognitive health. The proposed dissertation\nwork aspires to investigate the longitudinal effects of multiple dimensions of the living environments on social\nisolation and cognitive health for older adults, including physical environment measured by community and in-\nhome disorder and social environment measured by neighborhood cohesion.\n\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) has brought a revolution to the way people communicate\nand access resources.*””° With increased popularity among older people,”*° ICT provides excellent\nopportunities to address social isolation and promoting cognitive health.*\" An increasing amount of research\ninvestigating the association between ICT use and social isolation have been published, however, whether ICT\nuse would interact with the effect of environmental factors on the risk of social isolation has not yet been\nempirically tested.*’ Because ICT increases access to information and resources, adopting ICT possesses the\npotential to mitigate the effect of a disadvantaged living environment.\n\nFor the F99 phase, I will examine the longitudinal impact of the environments of living on social isolation and\ncognitive health with four waves of data from the National Health & Aging Trend Study (NHATS). The subjective\nperception of the environmental influence on social well-being will be elicited using focus groups. With the older\nadult participants’ input, | will explore the possible designs of a community-based, technology-facilitated\napproach that could sustainably enhance the social well-being and cognitive health of isolated older adults.\n\nCognition health is the foundation for independent living and quality of life. The effect of ICT use on cognitive\nhealth has not been extensively researched. Promoting social interaction using technology-based approaches\ncan alleviate the social isolation among older people and prevent cognitive decline at the same time, yet only a\nfew randomized controlled intervention studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of ICT-\nenhanced tools on cognitive functioning and social isolation.** The existing trial showed positive effects for ICT-\nenhanced intervention.\n\nAt the KOO phase, | will use the longitudinal data from the ongoing randomized controlled trial “Internet-based\nConversational Engagement Clinical Trial (-CONECT)” (NIA RO1AG056102, RO1AG056628 & R56AG051628)\nto investigate the mechanism of conversational engagement on the cognitive functioning. The I-CONECT trial is\ncurrently collecting digital bio-marker and neuroimaging data, including medication adherence, speech and\nlanguage characteristics, and region-specific structural and functional pre-post changes in the brain. Using this\nrich data set, [ plan to examine why and how social interaction affects the cognitive functioning of older adults,\nwhich is not well understood in literature, as well as how technology can be used effectively to alleviate isolation\nand improve cognitive functions.\n\nAim 1: In the F99 phase, | will examine the effect of physical and social environments on social isolation and\ncognitive health using a mixed-methods approach. ICT use is hypothesized to moderate the influence of physical\nand social environments.\n\nAim 2: [n the KOO phase, | will examine the effectiveness of an [CT-enhanced conversational intervention on\nsocial isolation and its effect on cognitive health among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive\nimpairment (MCI). | will explore the potential to co-design a technology-facilitated community-based intervention\nfrom an ETA perspective for social isolation and cognitive decline with older adult participants.\n\nSuccessfully achieving the aims of this proposal will produce knowledge on the environmental factors on the\nrisk of social isolation among older adult, contribute to the existing literature on the mechanisms of social\nengagement on cognitive health, and lead to the development of a technology-facilitated intervention program\nfor social isolation and cognitive decline from the perspective of ETA.\n\nSpecific Aims Page 56\n"

Environment and Social Isolation\n\nSocial isolation is the absence of contact with other individuals and a lack of relationships and social\nintegration.** Empirical evidence repeatedly showed that social isolation is associated with death by\ncardiovascular disease and early morbidity among older adults.7* A meta-analysis with 70 studies published\nbetween 1980 and 2014 showed that socially isolated individuals had a 29% increased likelihood of mortality.’\nThe research and practice fields have increasingly recognize the significance of addressing the problem of social\nisolation. AARP estimated that about 4 million older adults enrolled in Medicare are socially isolated, and\nMedicare spends an additional $6.7 billion on isolated individuals than otherwise if they are socially connected.\nEradicate the problem of social isolation requires a social approach. However, while the current literature has\nexplored the individual-level risk and protective factors of social isolation, such as personality and health\nconcerns, how does the physical and social characteristics of the living environment affects the experience of\nsocial isolation has not been well researched.\n\nThe Ecological Theory of Aging (ETA) posits environmental factors have significant influences on\nhealth and social wellbeing.””*>* Living environment provides access to resources, and the settings for social\ninteraction as well as an essential source of cognitive simulation.“ Living environments are often assessed\nthrough diverse dimensions including physical and social aspects of environments.”*\"° Physical environments\nrefer to the objective aspects of the neighborhood and the facilities, for example, the safety of the neighborhood,\naccess to amenities, green open spaces and aesthetics.*” While social environment often been operationalized\nas the social participation and social integration perceived by people, such as participate in social activities,\nsense of community, and trust in people. *°\n\nFor the association between physical environmental factors and social isolation, previous research\nreported that older residents of a high-crime neighborhood are more likely to be socially isolated despite their\nstrong desire for social integration.®°° The community disorders, which can present itself as litters on the streets,\ndeserted buildings, and vandalism, could lead to the perception of lack of safety, thus causes increased likelihood\nof social isolation. Outdoor space & public buildings, and common areas have a critical role in keeping the\nresidents living an active social life and contribute to their general wellbeing.*” Although existing literature shed\nlight on the role of the physical environment on social isolation, the evidence is built mainly on cross-sectional\ndata, the longitudinal association between the two warrants further research. The proposed dissertation work\naspires to build evidence with longitudinal data, and the following hypothesis was derived based on cross-\nsectional results and theoretical reasoning of ETA.\n\nH1: Negative physical characteristics of the environment, i.e., disorders in the community and at home, predicts\nthe increased social isolation in the community.\n\nSocial environmental factors like community support & health services, communication & information, civic\nparticipation, & employment have been empirically supported as protective factors of social isolation.“°*' Sense\nof belongingness, togetherness, and trust were found to be associated with a less sedentary lifestyle and more\nsocial participation and interpersonal interaction, and thus, predicts a lower extent of social isolation.”\nResidential satisfaction and sense of belonging was found negatively associated with perceived social isolation.”\nH2: Positive social environment factors (e.g., trust neighbors, people in the community, helping each other) are\nassociated with less social isolation longitudinally.\n\nOne's perception of the social environment is likely to be influenced by the physical characteristics\nof the environment. Sampson and Raudenbush (2004) reported that physical deterioration and disorder has a\nsocial meaning beyond just the observation of neighborhood disorder.** Physical characteristics of a living\nenvironment could change an individual's opinions of the social environments, resulting in less perceived\nopportunities in the neighborhood. For example, visible vandalism on the street could prevent residents from\nwalking on the streets, which could increase the incidence of social isolation.”\n\nH3: Social environmental factors mediate the longitudinal association between physical environmental factors\nand social isolation.\n\nWhy is it that the social and physical aspects of the living environment affect the social wellbeing of\nits older residents? This question remained unanswered with previous research. ETA provided three\npropositional processes for the environment to “get under the skin’, i.e., autonomy defined as the older adult\ntake action to change the environment to fit their needs, belonging defined as a sense of security, inclusion and\nconnectedness, and stress defined as the “environmental press” to which made the individual suffer.””*° Yet the\ncorresponding measures are not available in nationally representative longitudinal studies.

Environment, Social Isolation, and Cognitive Health\n\nPhysical and social environments not only affect the social wellbeing of older people but also fundamentally\ninfluences their cognitive health. Environments serve as one of the most pervasive and complex stimuli to the\nbrain and contribute to shaping cognitive functionality through the mechanism of neuroplasticity.“ Environmental\nchallenges, as simple as daily tasks like shopping, was hypothesized to simulate the brain because it requires\nan older person to remember the route and shopping list despite the distractors in the environments.\nEnvironmental stimuli, just like education and cognitively-demanding jobs, were theorized to be associated with\nincreased cognitive reserve and prevent cognitive decline.“ Considerable amount of research/practice interests\nand effects have been paid to building aging-friendly communities,“°*” however, little is known about the cognitive\neffects of the physical and social environments.” Carefully investigating specific aspects of visual\nsimulation in the living environment, such as disorder at home and in the community, is granted.\n\nCommunity disorder, such as cluttered and unsafe environment, increase the cognitive burden and the\nenvironmental stressors on the residents. Older adults living in communities with a higher number of adverse\nphysical environmental characteristics are more likely to be deprived of health care resources and cognitively\nstimulating activities.** Positive social environments provide the resources and opportunities that are necessary\nfor cognitive simulating engagements.***° Social environments were found to be significantly associated with\ncognitive functioning with cross-sectional data.*® Although the theoretical reasons supporting the\nassociation between specific physical and social environments and cognitive decline is substantial,\nempirical examinations of the relationships are scarce.**°° The proposed research project aspires to\ncontribute to the knowledge by building empirical evidence on physical environmental factors and cognitive\nhealth using longitudinal data. The following hypotheses were derived.\n\nH4: Negative physical environments, i.e., the disorder in community and homes, were longitudinally positively\nassociated with deterioration in cognitive function.\n\nH5: Positive social environment, i.e., neighborhood cohesion, longitudinally associated with deterioration in\ncognitive function.\n\nSocial isolation could mediate the association between physical and social environments and\ncognitive functioning. The literature review in the previous section established the reasoning for the\nassociations between physical and social environments and social isolation. Social isolation was found to predict\ncognitive decline longitudinally.” Perceived social isolation was associated with a higher cortical Amyloid burden\nin older adults, supporting the crucial role of social isolation in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease and related\ndementia.”\n\nH6: Social isolation mediates the longitudinal association between physical and social environments and\ncognitive function.\n\nAlthough ETA highlights the importance of the environment in the aging process in general, the theory did not\nspecifically discuss the effect of environments on cognitive health.”““ The knowledge that will be built in the\nproposed study could enrich the content and expanding the scope of ETA.\n\nResearch Strategy Page 58\n"

ICT, Social Isolation and Cognitive Health\n\nICT use has been found associated with reduced social isolation.°’** A systematic review reported that ICT\nalleviates the elderly's social isolation through four mechanisms: connecting to the outside world, gaining social\nsupport, engaging in activities of interests, and boosting self-confidence.” The ETA hypothesized ICT use\npromotes the wellbeing of older adults through enhancing their agency.*° However, the effect of ICT\ninterventions on social isolation were not able to last for more than 6 month after termination.°” Previous research\nnoted that the ICT intervention might not work for everyone in the diverse population of older adults with\nheterogonous personal characteristics and life experiences.” Future research are needed to identify how to\nimplement and contextualize ICT interventions in the older adult’s daily life so that the population would be more\nlikely to benefit from the ICT use.” Additionally, the nature and content of ICT use might result in different effects.\nInternet use for social purposes was reported to be associated with decreased perceived social isolation in the\nfollowing year, while the association between social isolation with instrumental use of internet was insignificant.”\nContextualizing the effect of ICT use within the ecological living environment of older adults could\ncontribute to the literature on what kind of ICT is effective in alleviating social isolation under what\ncircumstances.\n\nThe impact of ICT use within the context of the living environment will be explored for the first time in the\nproposed dissertation work and postdoctoral research. ICT adoption has the potential to reduce the negative\ninfluence of disadvantaged physical and social environments by providing a new avenue for older adults who\nsuffer health issues to interact with family, peers, and society.2”° ICT users reported that internet made it easier\nto reach people and increased the quantity of communication with others, thus supporting them in feeling less\nisolated.°' ICT corresponds to the information & communication aspect of the community environment, we\nhypothesize the effect of physical and social environment on social isolation is different for [CT users and non-\nICT users. In the F99 phase, I will investigate the interacted influence of physical and social environments and\nusing ICT for different purposes (social, instrumental, and medical) on social isolation.\n\nH7: ICT use will moderate the longitudinal association between physical and social environments and social\nisolation experienced by older adults. More specifically, individuals who use ICT for social purposes are less\nlikely to be socially isolated.\n\nThe effect of ICT use on cognitive health has not been extensively researched and well-understood.\nBesides, ICT is an umbrella term summarizing a variety of technological tools that could facilitate interpersonal\ninteraction. -CONECT intervention employs a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study design to investigate\nthe effect of a specific type of ICT use, i.e., Internet-facilitated conversational engagement via video-chat, on\ncognitive functioning among older adults who are cognitively intact or with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The\ntask of conversation is highly cognitively simulating, which requires control of attention, working memory,\nexecutive functions, and mental interpretation of other’s emotions and intentions.°4°° Linguistic ability is known\nas highly related to cognitive health among older adults.°° In the KOO Phase, I will utilize data collected in the I-\nCONECT project to examine the longitudinal intervention effect of ICT facilitated conversation on the social\nwellbeing and cognitive health of older adults.\n\nThe current I-CONECT intervention did not explicitly take into consideration the impact of physical and social\nenvironments. With the evidence will be built in the longitudinal secondary data analysis and qualitative focus\ngroups of in the dissertation, | will explore the possibility of designing a sustainable community-based program\nto offer a technology-facilitated solution to alleviate social isolation and prevent cognitive decline.*” Studying the\neffectiveness of technology in the living environment and explore new approaches of technology-facilitated care\ncould transform the older adults’ home to become more than a living space, but also a service platform.*®\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the conceptual framework for both F99 and KOO phases. Examining the physical and social\nenvironmental impacts on social isolation and cognitive health among older adults, this the proposed research\nhas the potential to produce a sustainable solution to the challenge of social isolation among older adults and\nthe increased likelihood of cognitive decline and ADRD onset accompanies with it. By contextualizing the role of\ntechnology in older adults’ living environments, knowledge will be built in the proposed research will address the\nchallenges of independent living and aging in place with technology tools that fit the circumstances. Although\nthe distinction between physical and social environments was proposed by the ETA, empirical evidence has\nexamined the subjective aspect of the living environment (i.e., social environment) less adequately. 22 The\nproposed work will contribute to the literature and expand the scope of ETA by studying both the physical and\nsocial environments and their relationships with social isolation and cognitive health.\n\n2.

Dataset\n\nThe proposed dissertation will use data from NHATS wave 5 (collected in 2015) to 8 (collected in 2018).\nNHATS is a longitudinal study that annually surveys Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and above in the contiguous\nUnited States (excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico). Medicare beneficiaries constitute more than 98% of\nthe US population age 65 and older. NHATS used a stratified three-stage Table 1. wave 5 NHATS sample characteristics\nsample design: 95 individual counties or groups of counties were selected as = _Demosraphicvariables nn %\nprimary sampling units (PSUs), and 655 zip codes were sampled from them as — Seezrours 9847 34.16\nsecondary sampling units (SSUs).

Probablydementia 963 11.68\n\n2.1.1a. Measurements .\n\nPhysical environments were reported by the interviewers who visited the respondents at their home.\nStanding in front of the respondent’s home/building and looking around, the interviewer rated on a four-\npoint scale (1=none, 4=a lot) regarding 1) the amount of litter on the street, 2) graffiti on buildings and walls, 3)\nvacant or deserted houses or stores. The physical condition of the respondent home was rated dichotomously\n(yes/no), in terms of, 1) any broken windows, 2) a crumbling foundation or open holes, 3) missing bricks or siding,\n4) roof problems, 5) uneven walking surface or broken steps, 6) continuous sidewalks in both directions (reverse\ncoded). The physical condition inside the responder’s home/apartment was assessed by observing the\nexistence of 1) peeling paint, 2) evidence of pests, 3) broken furniture, 4) flooring need of repair, 5) tripping\nhazards, and 6) cluttered room. The scale score of the physical conditions of the community, home/building, and\ninside home/apartmenits will be derived from the sum score of the corresponding items. The use of interviewers’\nobservation could provide more accurate information regarding the physical environment of each participant than\nusing the census data by zip code, which tends to reduce the complexity of the real-life condition.\n\nSocial environments. Respondents reported whether the people in the community know each other very\nwell, willing to help each other, and people in the community can be trusted on a three-point scale (1=agree a\nlot, 2=agree a little, 3=do not agree). A sum score of the three items will be used as the scale score for the social\nenvironment.\n\nICT use. NHATS assessed three types of ICT use: instrumental internet use, social internet use, and internet\nuse for medical purposes. Instrumental internet was measured by asking the respondent’s weather they shop\nonline and pay bills or banking with the internet. Social use was measured with one item asking in the last month\nif the respondent went online to visit social network sites (such as Facebook or Linkedin). Use the internet for\nmedical purposes had four items: order or refill prescriptions, contact medical providers, handle health insurance\nmatters, and get information about one's health conditions. The three aspects of ICT use will be used as\nmoderators that are independent of each other.\n\nSocial isolation was constructed with six dichotomously coded indicators: no marriage or partnership, no\nfamily identified to talk with about important things, no friend identified to talk with about important things, never\nmeeting in person with family or friends in the past month, no participation in religious service, and no club, class\nor organization activities participation.** All items of social isolation will be coded as a higher indicates a more\nisolated situation. The scale score is the sum of six dichotomous indicators, ranging from 0-6. Scores less than\n1 represent individuals who were least isolation; scale score 2-3 represent who was somewhat isolated, and\nscores equal or above 4 indicates social isolation.\n\nCognitive Health. For sampled persons self-responded cases, NHATS study assessed 1) memory: using\nimmediate and delayed words recall; 2) orientation: date, month, year and day of the week, naming the\nPresident and Vice President of the United States; and 3) executive function measured by clock drawing test.”\nIf the interview were conducted with a proxy, AD-8 Dementia Screening Interview was used to assess memory,\ntemporal orientation, judgment, and function.©*?\n\nResearch Strategy Page 60\n"

Demographics including age, gender, race, education level, marital status, income, and\nself-rated health have been reported in existing literature as predictors for social isolation among older adults\n1320.64 Therefore, the current study includes the variables listed above as control variables.\n\n2.1.1b. Quantitative data analysis strategies\n\nData management and variable re-coding will be conducted using Stata 15 SE. Prior to model building,\nunivariate analysis and correlation of key variables will be run to estimate the effect size and detect any potential\nmulticollinearity issues. Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) will be employed to model the longitudinal\nrelationships between physical environments, social environments, social isolation, and cognitive health. LGCM\nallows nested models at hierarchical levels, such as observations of the same individual are nested within the\nperson, individuals live in the same neighborhood would have similar physical environments with regard to\ndisorder at the community level. As a special case of structural equation modeling (SEM), LGCM is well suited\nfor modeling mediation paths (H3, H6). Besides, the LGCM is capable of testing the moderating effects of ICT\nuse (H7).° Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis\nindex (TLI) were used to evaluate the extent to which each model fits the data.

Qualitative inquiry with I-CONECT participants\n\n2.1.2a. Data collection and procedure\n\nFocus group participants will be recruited purposefully among the current [-CONECT participants. Based on\nthe strategy of maximum variation,® individuals with diverse living environment conditions will be selected to\nparticipate in the focus group discussion. Focus group members will be selected from both study sites of I-\nCONECT (OHSU & UM). Two focus groups will be held at each site: one with intervention group participants,\nthe other with control group participants. It is targeted for each focus group to have 8 participants (total N=32).\nTo avoid contamination of the intervention effect, only participants who have completed the I-CONCET study will\nbe invited to join the focus group study. Given the study timeline of the I-CONECT, the qualitative inquiry will\nextend from F99 phase to KOO phase. The interview guide will be developed informed by concepts in ETA and\nin consultation with experts with qualitative/mixed-methods research specialties (Palinkas) and with the best\nknowledge of I-CONECT participants (Dodge). The PD/PI (Yu) will facilitate the focus group discussion at both\nOHSU and UM.\n\n2.1.2b. Qualitative data analysis\n\nConversations in focus group sessions will be audio-recorded and then transcribe verbatim for analysis. The\ntranscripts will be analyzed using inductive content analysis method by at least two trained independent coders.”\nThe coders are going to collaborate with qualitative analysis software Nvivo 12. The qualitative data coding team\nwill meet regularly to discuss the coding framework, procedure, and to reconcile different opinions and\ninterpretations of the quotations in the transcripts. The team will employ Cohen’s kappa coefficient as the\nindicator for inter-rater reliability.”\" Themes identified in the coding process will be reorganized and made sense\nof according to the personal and living environmental characteristics of the participants.\n2.1.3. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data\n\nThe qualitative and quantitative inquires of the dissertation work will occur concurrently. The main purpose of\nadopting the mixed-methods is using qualitative data to explain why there might be effects of physical and social\nenvironments on social isolation. The qualitative focus groups expanded the discussions on the findings\nidentified in the quantitative analysis.” Meanwhile, participant's insights on designing a sustainable\nenvironmental-focused technology program to address social isolation and promote cognitive health will be\nelicited. The findings of both qualitative and quantitative components of the dissertation work together as\nfoundations for developing an intervention program that can be pilot tested in the postdoctoral training phase\nand beyond.\n2.2.

Training Plan, Environment, Research Facilities\n\nMs. Yu proposes to examine the longitudinal influence of physical and social living environments on social\nisolation and cognitive health among older adults with National Health & Aging Trends (NHATS) data. The\nproposed dissertation will be the known first to contextualize the role of ICT use through examining the interaction\neffects of the physical environment with ICT use and the social environment with ICT use on social isolation and\ncognitive decline. An ecological perspective has rarely been adopted to studying the intertwined relationships\nbetween social well-being and cognitive health. With the population aging rate continues to increase, Ms. Yu’s\nresearch will enhance the research field’s understanding of the ecological support system on mental health and\ncognition in the rapidly changing society. Ms. Yu proposes to develop and pilot testing a community-based\nintervention that has the potential to provide a sustainable solution to keep the older adults socially connected\nand prevent the onset of dementia. Her work will be meaningful to address the challenge of social isolation and\nthe burden of care brought by the increasingly prevalent ADRD conditions. Ms. Yu’s training plan incorporates\nboth coursework, seminars, and mentorship opportunities provided by sponsors with diverse and complementary\nskillsets. The proposed research and training agenda works together to advance Ms. Yu’s research skills and\nscholarship.\n\nWith the receipt of this award, Ms. Yu will have the opportunity to receive training from an outstanding\nmentoring team made up of leaders in the fields of Neurology, Engineering, Anthropology, and Social Work.\nEach of the sponsors has influential research works committed to improving the quality of lives for the older adult\npopulation. The sponsor team members will collaborate to aid Ms. Yu to achieve her long term career goal of\nbecoming an independent social scientist and an impactful intervention researcher that dedicated to improve\nsocial well-being and prevent cognitive decline. Ms. Yu will work with Dr. Wu to further gain expertise in using\ntechnology-facilitated tools to improve health outcomes and increase access to health care for the populations\nin need. She will work with Dr. Dodge to increase her understanding of cognitive health and dementia research,\nto grow her capacity of neuroimaging methodology and using digital biomarkers in her research. Ms. Yu will work\nwith Dr. Palinkas to refine her skills in mixed-methods research and receive consultation on designing and\nimplementing community-based health interventions. Ms. Yu will apply the skills developed from the\nindividualized training plan to write her dissertation, seek to publish in high-impact journals, and develop a\nresearch agenda beyond the postdoctoral training stage than leads to her career success.\n\n| serve as the primary sponsor of Ms. Yu’s F99/KO0 application. | will be the coordinator for communication\namong the co-sponsors.

Working with the sponsoring team, Ms. Yu has identified the following\ntraining goals and listed specific plans that lead to achieving these goals.\n\nTraining Goal 1: Ms. Yu will increase knowledge in prevention, intervention, and current practice and\npolicy pertain cognitive decline in normal aging and the development of ADRD. Dr. Wu is currently\nconducting research with older adults with ADRD and their family caregivers. She will connect Ms. Yu with\nresearchers with similar interests at the USC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). Ms. Yu will work\nwith Dr. Wu and myself to develop a literature review database on cognitive health and ADRD research. Dr. Wu\nleads a health system journal club with graduate students under her supervision. At the bi-weekly journal club,\nMs. Yu will have opportunities to present her learned ADRD related knowledge. She will have interactive\ndiscussions and receive feedback from peers and Dr. Wu and myself.

The USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work (USCSSW) established\nthe first social work doctoral Program in the western United States in 1953. Today we continue the tradition of\nadmitting highly motivated, self-directed individuals interested in university research and teaching. Students\nPursue an in-depth, Customized course of study in an atmosphere of careful mentoring and respect for\nscholarship. Our doctoral curriculum is highly interdisciplinary with the intent of Producing graduates who are\nCapable of original research and passionate about advancing the profession’s knowledge base. Our program\nfosters early engagement in research and Publication, together with a structured and Sequential experience in\nclassroom teaching. Unique developmental opportunities are offered to improve students’ presentation skills,\nnetworking with other universities, and leadership potential, Our goal is to make students competitive for the\nbest available Positions in this country and elsewhere in this world,\n\nProgram Structure. Doctoral students at USCSSW are required to complete a minimum of 45 course units\nbeyond the master's degree (exclusive of the Doctoral Dissertation). During the first year of the PhD Program,\nStudents complete 8 Courses (16 units) in social work policy practice and research and Participate in faculty-\ndirected research Projects. Core Substantive Courses include: Theories of Human Behavior in the Context of\nSocial Environments; Explanatory Theories for Larger Social Systems; Theories for Practice with Small and Large\nSystems. Core Research/Statistics Courses include: Introduction to Social Work Statistics; Multiple Regression\nin Social Work Research; Advanced Social Work Research Methods. During the second year of the PhD Program,\nStudents are required to enroll in advanced multivariate statistics and at least three courses (per semester) in\nother departments or schools within the university. At least eight of these 12 units must be in courses with a\nsubstantive rather than a research methodology or statistics focus. Additional second year requirements include\nthree student-directed tutorials (2-unit) under the mentorship of a social work faculty member. Tutorials provide\n\ngreater understanding of the student's chosen specialty through a closer examination of relevant practice\ntheories, explanatory theories, and research methodologies. Each tutorial is designed to Produce a study of\npublishable quality. In the third year of the PhD Program, students must pass a qualifying examination in their\nresearch area, which consists of a written Paper of publishable quality and includes an Oral defense. After Passing\nthe qualifying exam, students are advanced to candidacy. Year Four and Beyond- Dissertation: Before\nproceeding with the dissertation, students must establish a dissertation committee approved by the Graduate\nSchool and submit a dissertation Proposal for approval. Students submit their completed dissertation to their\ndissertation committee and orally defend it.\nUniversity of Southern California\noS eee—EeeEeEeE\nPage 77\nCP\n"
