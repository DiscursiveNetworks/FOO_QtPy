Specific'Aims:
in the:US;, there:has been a‘polarized:debate:about whether lifé,.long-term:care,,and disability insurers,
teferred to.as ‘suppléméntall” irisufers, stiould bé:abléto Use ah applicant's:genetic information when. settifig:
rates:or accepting policies: This ‘debate usually references highly predictive and serious genetic diseases;such
vas:Huntington’s Disease.or Lynch Syndrome.-In-reality; most.variants havea wide range of predictive.values;
from unknowh'to'low:to high. There has:been little. debate about:how predictive a-variant must befor’
supplemental insurers: to usé—or to be legally-allowéd‘to se—the. information. Additionally,.for'some highly.
‘predictive:variants, medical:interventions:may be available to:minimize‘one’s indicated ,risk,.and the.law does
‘ot currently shed light‘on how: insurérs should consider this information. Staté.unfair trade practice laws
generally require: itisurers to have actuarial justification forusing any tisk factor in undétwriting: Under these.
actuarial laws, to:denyan-application archarge an increased premium, insurers must show:that a:relevant risk
factor‘is’statistically. associated with increased insurer cost: However, in the US; theré.has been little research
regarding ‘the application of these standards to’ genétic’and: genomic data. Internationally; several couritries;.
sUich.as.the UK and Australia, have had actuarial policies for supplemental insurers specific'to genetic:-testing
‘sincetheearly:2000s: Thus, most:of the academiciand policy discussions in-this:area have.occurred abroad..
‘Although the: Genetic. Information: Nondiserimination Act (GINA) protects:against-genetic-discrimination:in _
employment:and:health insurarice; individuals may<fail to. undertake medically recommended:clinical genetic
testing,.of participate it, génomic:réséarch, due to féars Of discrimination in’supplémental insurance. Policy
responses:tend to focus on whether supplemental insurérs:should. beable to use:genetic information, but:do
not‘explore:the broader. criteria that inform: when:and how-such:information:can legally-be used.;Once:studied,.
‘these. criteria‘can ifforrfi/a more: htianced policy discussion‘of the“should’. This. project has two primary goals:
‘1)'to systematically:examine the legal-and policy landscapé.of supplemental insurer use. of genetic information
in:the: US and internationally -with:particular-focus on requirements:of-actuarial justification; and:2) to.use:these:
réquirements tovoffer‘a variety-of policy,options:for US: state:and federal governments that.seékito-address
‘genetic discritination'in supplemerital insurance: To meet these goals; | propose three:specific. dims:
Aim'1.—Analyze: how intérmational.approaches:to ‘actuarial justification; supplemental insurance, and:génetic
information maybe applicable-to'the-US. Using methods.and analysis techniques. acquired during the
mentored-phase, Iwill: choose four‘countries:that have robust policies:regarding actuarial justification:and:
insurer'use‘of genétic:information and conduct:casé.studies' of thesé.examiples. Focus: 6n actuarial‘standards’
in‘the ‘international privatized supplemental insurance sector ensures.a more direct comparison with the US;
despite:differences:across. health insurance:sectors: | will’explore why-specific policy options were chosen,
whether'these:policies:address' issues:related to‘predictive-value or preventive measures, -how‘effective the
policiés have béeh, ‘and. what lessons were learned. Case-study analysis-will combine both policy analysisand
targeted ‘interviews,with key’ stakeholders such.as:academic/policy experts, government officials, advocacy’
-group:representatives,:and insurance: representatives.
Aim:2 = Interrogate how existing US ‘state: laws-that require: actuarial justification in-supplemental:insurance
would:apply-to-use of genetic:information. Using multiple:methods, | will:explore how .current:state law:may
are.interpreting:and enforcing actuarial.and unfair trade, practice laws. (Aim:2a), |:will. combine«this-with legal
analysis: of statutes, regulations; and:applicable:case. law to:evaluate whether:state law‘has:been:applied'to:the
‘Context:6f.géhetic information“and how the laws: may be-interpreted afd ’enforéed in this.area:(Aim' 2b). Survey
responses will inform the’ legal'analysis of how existing legislation may-be enforced or interpreted,
Aim:3 — Provide policy analysis:and recommendations. for legislative.and regulatory options to address:
‘concerns about the use of genetic:information.in:supplemental insurance: | will undertake policy analysis:of
‘options.available to US:governments:to- address. societal:anid individual concerns:about'supplemental.insurer
use Of genetic’information (Aim '3a).Additional policy analysis will exploré légal anid‘ policy-optioris for the:
‘threshold evidence levels'needed to meet actuatial.standards (Aim 3b). These-options will incorporate:
feedback from: policy experts. | will.disseminate recommendations:through policy briefs and:manuscripts.
Aims:1 and:2a:(K99: phase) will-be:completed.in:concert-with ‘training:‘in qualitative;and quantitative methods:
For'the:RO0 phase, my goal is to secure:a‘tenured law:position that involves teaching:an.experiential course:
and researching ELSI topics. Under this model, studerits'will:assistin the research’ goals of Airis 2b'and 3:
‘By'combining’policy:analysis-and Casé.studies from:the:international:setting with :detailed-legal:and survey’
‘analysi§ froin thé US,, this: projéct will produce a'robust study of potential policy optioris for legislators..

temained ehttenched in‘disctission about whether-or not insurers should; beable to-use: genetic information
(Mittra2007). There has been little research and'policy discussion of, if supplemental insurers have access to
genetic:information; when.and:how they:should be able.to-use it in underwriting, This:research project
examines how law:and policy“address, or’should address;'the thiteshold of statistical ‘sigriificarice between
‘genetic information:and increased ‘risk necessary for insurers to charge higher premium rates or:deny:a policy.
‘In, 2008;-in, response to, the-public's-concetnis of genetic discrimination, Congress: passed ‘the Genetic
Information. Nondiserimination.Act:(GINA).;GINA prevents:employers.and health: insurers from using:genetic
information:to-discriminate, but does not regulate how ‘supplemental insurers useigenetic information: (McGuire
2009)::Thése insurers were not included in GINA dué ‘to political compromise’and recognition that the:
‘economic.models‘and social goals of:'supplemental insurance:raise-different:policy considerations than health

discrifination in‘supplemental insurance (Allain 2042, Laedtke.2012,.Parkrnati:2014). This fear may lead

‘Sinee:federal law does not address supplemental. insurer‘use’of genetic information, any US-based policy: in
‘this area.currently comes.from state law. Several states:address:insurer‘use:of:genetic'information (NCSL. _
2008). Three:states.are commonly’cited:as: banning supplemental. insurér‘use*of.genetic: information (Peikoff:

‘such.as prémium ineréases or denials, is a:cotnmion legislative strategy.- Thésé laws generally require that
