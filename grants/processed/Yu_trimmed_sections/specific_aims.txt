Specific Aims

Social well-being and cognitive health are two essential components of successful aging.’ Three decades of
research have consistently shown that social isolation is associated with the onset of cardiovascular disease,” “
declines in cognitive function,’ higher risks of depression and anxiety,® and lower overall life satisfaction.’
Perceived social isolation was associated with a higher cortical Amyloid burden in older adults, supporting the
crucial role of social isolation in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia.’? The potential causes of
social isolation are multi-faceted. While the existing literature studied individual-level factors that were associated
with social isolation, such as age, *"’, personality '*"'” and health status, '**' only a few studies have examined
the extent to which the living environment influences the experience of social isolation among older adults.

The Ecological Theory of Aging (ETA) posits that the living environment profoundly influences the aging
process.””** The process of personal and environmental resource exchange determines the aging outcomes
through building their identity, evoking or reducing stress, and maintaining or hindering the autonomy of an older
person.” Environments not only affect social well-being of older adults, but it also serves as one of the most
pervasive and complex stimuli to the brain and contribute to shaping cognitive functionality through the
mechanism of neuroplasticity.* Socially isolated individuals are at higher risk of cognitive decline.”*”* Social
isolation might mediate the association between environments and cognitive health. The proposed dissertation
work aspires to investigate the longitudinal effects of multiple dimensions of the living environments on social
isolation and cognitive health for older adults, including physical environment measured by community and in-
home disorder and social environment measured by neighborhood cohesion.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has brought a revolution to the way people communicate
and access resources.*””° With increased popularity among older people,”*° ICT provides excellent
opportunities to address social isolation and promoting cognitive health.*" An increasing amount of research
investigating the association between ICT use and social isolation have been published, however, whether ICT
use would interact with the effect of environmental factors on the risk of social isolation has not yet been
empirically tested.*’ Because ICT increases access to information and resources, adopting ICT possesses the
potential to mitigate the effect of a disadvantaged living environment.

For the F99 phase, I will examine the longitudinal impact of the environments of living on social isolation and
cognitive health with four waves of data from the National Health & Aging Trend Study (NHATS). The subjective
perception of the environmental influence on social well-being will be elicited using focus groups. With the older
adult participants’ input, | will explore the possible designs of a community-based, technology-facilitated
approach that could sustainably enhance the social well-being and cognitive health of isolated older adults.

Cognition health is the foundation for independent living and quality of life. The effect of ICT use on cognitive
health has not been extensively researched. Promoting social interaction using technology-based approaches
can alleviate the social isolation among older people and prevent cognitive decline at the same time, yet only a
few randomized controlled intervention studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of ICT-
enhanced tools on cognitive functioning and social isolation.** The existing trial showed positive effects for ICT-
enhanced intervention.

At the KOO phase, | will use the longitudinal data from the ongoing randomized controlled trial “Internet-based
Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (-CONECT)” (NIA RO1AG056102, RO1AG056628 & R56AG051628)
to investigate the mechanism of conversational engagement on the cognitive functioning. The I-CONECT trial is
currently collecting digital bio-marker and neuroimaging data, including medication adherence, speech and
language characteristics, and region-specific structural and functional pre-post changes in the brain. Using this
rich data set, [ plan to examine why and how social interaction affects the cognitive functioning of older adults,
which is not well understood in literature, as well as how technology can be used effectively to alleviate isolation
and improve cognitive functions.

Aim 1: In the F99 phase, | will examine the effect of physical and social environments on social isolation and
cognitive health using a mixed-methods approach. ICT use is hypothesized to moderate the influence of physical
and social environments.

Aim 2: [n the KOO phase, | will examine the effectiveness of an [CT-enhanced conversational intervention on
social isolation and its effect on cognitive health among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). | will explore the potential to co-design a technology-facilitated community-based intervention
from an ETA perspective for social isolation and cognitive decline with older adult participants.

Successfully achieving the aims of this proposal will produce knowledge on the environmental factors on the
risk of social isolation among older adult, contribute to the existing literature on the mechanisms of social
engagement on cognitive health, and lead to the development of a technology-facilitated intervention program
for social isolation and cognitive decline from the perspective of ETA.
