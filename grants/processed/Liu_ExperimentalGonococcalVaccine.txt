SPECIFIC AIMS

The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a prophylactic vaccine against Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (i.e., gonorrhea). In Phase I, using a murine model of genital gonococcal infection, we have
established Proof-of-Principle that i.vag. immunization with a proprietary sustained-release particulate
interleukin-12 (IL-12) formulation plus gonococcal outer membrane vesicles (OMV) - the combination we refer
to as GvaX12° - induces durable Th1-driven adaptive immune responses that protect against genital tract
infection with heterologous strains of N. gonorrhoeae [progress report]. In fulfilling the Phase | milestones we
demonstrated (i) induction of gonococcus-specific Th1 cells, (ii) generation of anti-gonococcal antibodies in
serum and genital tract secretions, (iii) protection against diverse strains of N. gonorrhoeae, (iv) recall of
specific antibodies and reactivation of T cells after challenge infection, and (v) duration of protection against
infection for 6 months. In addition we have shown that protection depends on both antibodies and IFNy.

In Phase II, we will use the same murine model to identify alternative routes of immunization that may be more
applicable to humans (potentially including males), and determine the basis of protective immunity against
antigenically diverse clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae. In addition, we will perform preliminary
pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies and prepare materials for submission to the FDA for a type C meeting.

The specific aims for Phase II are as follows:

Aim 1: Define, optimize, and validate a vaccination regimen. This aim will encompass three tasks:

A. Determine a route of administration, intranasal vs. intravaginal, with respect to: 1) protection
against challenge with N. gonorrhoeae ; and 2) immune response correlates of protection (i.e.,
antibody titers, antibody specificity and T cell cytokine responses).

B. Determine the basis of cross-protective immunity against antigenically diverse clinical isolates of
N. gonorrhoeae

C. Determine whether immunization with detergent-extracted OMV-containing GvaX12° induces
protective immune responses against N. gonorrhoeae

Aim 2: Rodent pharmacokinetics and reproductive toxicology. This aim involves two tasks:
A. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of IL-12 following intravaginal and intranasal administration
of GvaX12° in mice.
B. Conduct reproductive toxicology studies in rats (i.e., embryonic-fetal development and effects on
pre- post-natal development )

Aim 3: Request a type C pre-pre-IND meeting with the FDA and prepare a briefing package with written
questions. Upon successful completion of Aims 1 and 2, TherapyX'”’ will request a type C pre-pre-IND
meeting with the FDA and prepare a briefing package with written questions. At this meeting, we will seek
agency guidance to shape future toxicological and clinical study designs

Milestones to be accomplished:

Year 1:

1. Demonstrate efficacy of intra-nasal versus intra-vaginal routes of vaccine delivery;
2. Elucidate the basis of cross-protection against antigenically diverse strains;

Year 2:

3. Determine whether detergent-extracted OMV are effective as a vaccine immunogen;
4. Define systemic exposure and the potential for reproductive toxicity;

5. Receive agency guidance that will shape toxicological and clinical study designs.

Upon successful completion of these aims TherapyX'”’ will submit an SBIR Phase IIb grant application, which

will seek to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity of this vaccine in non-human primates, and
prepare for an IND submission.

RESEARCH STRATEGY

1. Significance

Despite public health control measures, gonorrhea remains an all-too-common disease, and is the second
most frequent reportable infectious disease in the US. Although the reported incidence of this disease
exceeds 350,000 cases per annum (1), the real incidence is estimated to be 820,000 cases per annum (2).
World-wide incidence is now estimated at 78 million new cases per annum (3). Women bear the greater
morbidity because untreated gonorrhea can lead to upper tract infection and pelvic inflammatory disease, with
tubal scarring, infertility, and risk for ectopic pregnancy which can be life-threatening. Gonorrhea also
increases the risk of acquisition and transmission of HIV up to 5-fold in both sexes (4). Because no vaccine is
available (5), both its control and treatment depend upon antibiotics. However, N. gonorrhoeae has steadily
developed resistance to each class of antibiotics deployed against it, including fluoroquinolones and most
recently even extended-spectrum cephalosporins, raising serious concerns that gonorrhea could become
untreatable (6). The CDC has listed antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae as one of the top three pathogens
presenting “an immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action” (7). A recent WHO
technical consultation on vaccines against sexually transmitted infections (to which our collaborator Dr. Russell
contributed) called for renewed efforts to develop a vaccine against gonorrhea (8, 9). In June 2015, the NIAID
convened a workshop to discuss the status of gonococcal vaccine development that both Dr. Russell and the
PI attended (see report published in ref. 10).

Several previous attempts have been made to develop vaccines against gonorrhea, three in recent times
although only two went into clinical trial (reviewed in 11, 12). The first, based on killed whole gonococci,
proved ineffective as did a later and substantially larger effort based on gonococcal pili; the third based on
porin protein was abandoned. These disappointments discouraged further efforts and engendered pessimism
that vaccination against gonorrhea might not be feasible. Contributing to this situation is the well-known
observation that uncomplicated gonorrhea can be acquired repeatedly with apparently no development of
protective immunity resulting from previous infection. The reasons for this are poorly understood, but it is
generally thought that extensive antigenic variation coupled with multiple mechanisms for resisting complement
enable N. gonorrhoeae to evade whatever adaptive immune responses the host develops against it.
Consequently, in the absence of a reproducible state of immunity, the determinants of human immune
protection have not been defined.

Recent studies in our collaborator’s laboratory using a mouse model of genital gonococcal infection have cast
new light on this problem. It was shown that N. gonorrhoeae selectively elicits innate host defenses that it
can survive and concomitantly suppresses adaptive immune responses that would eliminate it, by
mechanisms involving IL-10, TGFB, and type 1 regulatory T cells (13-17). These studies further showed
that: 1) immunosuppression can be reversed by neutralizing TGF£ and IL-10 (14, 17); and 2) local intravaginal
(i.vag.) treatment with TherapyX'""’s sustained-release nanoparticulate IL-12 formulation (but not soluble IL-12)
during gonococcal infection accelerates clearance of the infection and induces resistance to secondary
infection several weeks later (18). This latter finding implies the development and recall of immune memory
(18). We therefore inferred that i.vag. nanoparticulate IL-12 effectively turned the infection into a live vaccine,
and consequently proposed that it could serve as an adjuvant for a non-viable prophylactic gonococcal vaccine.

This notion was directly tested in our Phase | work. The data demonstrated that prophylactic vaccination with
a formulation containing particulate IL-12 plus gonococcal outer membrane vesicles (GvaX12°) administered
i.vag resulted in long-term protection from subsequent challenge (see Phase | data below, 19). Thus we now
have a candidate prophylactic vaccine for clinical development.

2. Innovation:

The innovative aspects of our proposal are two-fold. First, we now have a novel approach for developing a
vaccine against N. gonorrhoeae based on a small animal model in which we can reliably induce a state of
protective immunity against genital gonococcal infection. This situation was never attained in the previous
unsuccessful efforts to create a gonococcal vaccine and represents a major conceptual advance. We have
found that mice can be immunized i.vag. with GvaX12® to generate protection against subsequent challenge

with live N. gonorrhoeae (progress report). Having established Proof-of-Principle, we now hypothesize that
protective immunity against genital gonococcal infection depends upon: 1) Th1-driven production of anti-
gonococcal antibodies (Abs) in serum and genital secretions; and 2) immune memory that can be recalled on
subsequent exposure to N. gonorrhoeae.

Second, the sustained-release nanoparticulate IL-12 formulation, a critical component of GvaX12°, represents
an important technological innovation. Our patented phase inversion nanoencapsulation (PIN®) process
provides a mild encapsulation methodology without loss of structural integrity or biological activity of
macromolecules (20). Studies of encapsulation efficiency, release kinetics, and post-encapsulation specific
activity studies established that excipient-stabilized macromolecules can be incorporated in poly-lactic acid
(PLA) particles in a two-step process with 90% efficiency, fully-preserved bioactivity and storage stability for up
to one year (21). Finally, recent scale-up work at TherapyX'" has achieved commercial methods for the
production of kilogram size batches of the formulation removing a major hurdle that has thwarted the
development of similar products. Thus GvaX12° is now ideally situated for development as a vaccine that
induces Th1-driven protective immunity against N. gonorrhoeae.

3. Approach
3.1 Phase | Results

In Phase | of this SBIR grant we established proof-of-principle that i.vag. immunization with GvaXx12°
induces adaptive Th1i-driven immune responses that protect against genital gonococcal infection.
Gonococcal outer membrane vesicles (OMV) were selected as the immunogen because they contain most
gonococcal surface antigens (Ags) in native conformation, whereas in heat- or formaldehyde-killed cells some
Ags may be denatured. Moreover, gonococcal OMV have been used to immunize mice intranasally, though
with variable results (11, 12, 22), and meningococcal OMV vaccines have been developed against N.
meningitidis and successfully used in humans (23).

We have attained the Milestones stated in the Phase | application as follows:

Milestone 1: Intra-vaginal immunization with GvaX12° protects from genital gonococcal infection by inducing
IFNy-secreting T cells specific for gonococcal antigen in the draining iliac lymph nodes (Fig. 1).

Figure 1: Gvax12° protects from Ngo challenge and induces Ngo-specific T-cell immunity in a murine model of
Ngo infection. In this model (19) , young female mice in diestrus are treated with estradiol, placed on antibiotics
to suppress the overgrowth of commensals, and then vaginally infected by instilling a suspension of freshly grown,
virulent N. gonorrhoeae. Infection, monitored by vaginal swabbing and plating, typically clears in 2-3 weeks, and is
accompanied by an influx of neutrophils. Vaccine efficacy is determined by the change in the rate of Ngo clearance after
challenge. Mice (N=8) were immunized twice with gonococcal (Ngo; FA1090) OMV (50yg protein) plus blank or IL-12
particles (1ug IL-12); controls were sham-immunized with blank particles or with NTHI OMV plus IL-12 particles
(Gvax12°). Two weeks later, all mice were challenged with Ngo strain FA1090. A: recovery of Ngo (mean +SEM, CFU),

weeks after the last immunization with 1, 2, or 3 doses of gonococcal OMV (50ug protein) plus IL-12/ms (1g IL-12).

The above data establish that GvaX12® enabled mice to reject a bacterial challenge more effectively than
vaccination with OMV/blank particles and that the clearance of bacteria was associated with a Th1 response.

Milestone 2: Anti-gonococcal Ab were generated in serum and vaginal secretions by i.vag. immunization with
Gvax12® (Fig. 2).

3.2 The Phase II Project

The goal of this proposed Phase II SBIR project is to advance GvaX12® towards Clinical trials by: 1) developing
a more practicable vaccination regimen in terms of the route of administration (intranasal vs. intravaginal); 2)
determining immune response correlates of protection: 3) determining the basis for protection against naturally
occurring, antigenically diverse, clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae; 4) perform bioavailability, pharmacokinetic,
and initial safety studies on GvaX12° in rats; and 5) prepare a briefing package with written questions for the
FDA, requesting a pre-pre-IND meeting. The FDA’s response will be used to guide continued development
including OMV scale up, and immune response and toxicological studies in non-human primates. The results
should also enable (i) defining the specificity and type of immune responses that need to be generated to elicit
protective immunity, and (ii) framing hypotheses for testing in clinical trials.

The proposed studies will be limited to female mice. The female mouse is the only animal model currently
available for experimental in vivo studies of genital gonococcal infections and immunity to them (24); there is
no experimental animal model for male tract gonococcal infection. Moreover, women suffer the greater burden
of morbidity from gonorrhea, because of the potential for damage to the reproductive tract that arises from
ascending infection. This infection can lead to tubal scarring, hence infertility; increased risk of ectopic
pregnancy; and painful and debilitating pelvic inflammatory disease. A developing fetus can be infected in
utero, leading to pre-term birth or septic abortion, and an infant delivered through an infected birth canal risks
ocular infection that can lead to blindness. Therefore, limiting our studies to female mice is not only
unavoidable but also justifiable in addressing the greater problem in females.

3.2.1 Specific Aim 1: Define, optimize and validate a vaccine regimen

Task 1A: To determine an optimal route of immunization: intravaginal vs. intranasal

The current i.vag. immunization regimen, although shown to be effective in our Phase | studies, is thought to
be impracticable for human prophylactic application, because i.vag. immunization likely will be unacceptable
for adolescent girls and many women, and inapplicable for males. However, substantial literature, including
studies in our collaborator’s laboratory, shows that intranasal (i.n.) immunization elicits responses in the genital
tract, in primates and in males as well as females (25-27), and may be even more effective than i.vag.
immunization for generating genital antibody responses (28).

Compare protection against challenge with N. gonorrhoeae

Based on our previous gonococcal immunization and infection studies (13, 14, 16-18), including the phase |
results shown above, we will use groups of 8-12 female mice, BALB/c or C57BL/6 strains, at 2-4 months of
age. The mice will be prepared for gonococcal challenge (24) by injecting s.c. with 0.5mg estradiol (Premarin)
on days —2, 0, and +2, placed on an antibiotic regime, and challenged by i.vag. instillation of 5x10° CFU of
freshly grown N. gonorrhoeae. The course of infection will be monitored by taking daily vaginal swabs for
viable cell counting on selective agar (a GC agar base supplemented with IsoVitalex, hemin, and antibiotics:
streptomycin, vancomycin, nystatin, colistin, and trimethoprim). Statistical analysis by 2-way ANOVA of CFU
recovered at each time point or by Kaplan-Meier analysis of the number of mice remaining infected each day
(clearance is defined as at least 3 successive days of negative gonococcal recovery) has revealed significant
differences (P <0.05 or lower) between control and experimental groups, each with at least 8 animals
completing the experiments. To guard against inadvertent loss of mice through accident (a rare event) or
overgrowth of commensal microbiota under estrogen treatment, experiments will be commenced with groups
of at least 10 animals. Experiments requiring challenge after a prolonged interval, e.g., up to 6 months will
start with 12 animals. Experiments will be performed and gonococcal recovery will be enumerated by persons
who are “blinded” to the group designations. All experiments will be repeated 2-3 times.

l.vag. immunization has been successfully achieved by instilling GvaxX12° containing OMV prepared as
described (19, 29) from N. gonorrhoeae strains FA1090, MS11, or FA19 (containing 40g protein) plus IL-12
particles (1g murine IL-12) and repeating the dose 2 weeks later (See above). We will compare this regimen
with administering the same dose of GvaX12° intranasally (i.n.) to a group of 10-12 female mice, and giving a
second similar dose 2-3 weeks later. Control groups will include sham-immunized mice given vehicle only by
the same routes. Additional controls for the i.n. route will include mice immunized with OMV plus blank
particles, or with IL-12 particles alone. As these latter controls have previously been performed repeatedly by

Research Strategy Page 83

the i.vag. route and shown to be no different from sham-immunization, they will not be routinely repeated. Two
weeks after the second immunization, mice will be challenged with N. gonorrhoeae of the same strain as used
to prepare the OMV, and infection monitored by vaginal swabbing and plating. The results will be evaluated
statistically using 2-way ANOVA of gonococcal CFU recovered, and Kaplan-Meier analysis of the number of
mice remaining infected, to determine (a) if protection against gonococcal challenge is achieved by i.n.
immunization with GvaX12°® (compared to controls), and (b) whether i.n. immunization is as effective as i.vag.
immunization.

Compare immune responses with i.n. versus i.vag. immunization

As in our previous studies, serum, saliva, and vaginal wash samples will be collected from mice prior to
immunization, ~2 weeks after immunization and prior to challenge, and at termination (after clearance of
infection) for assay of anti-gonococcal Abs (IgG and IgA; IgM Ab are low, variable, and uninformative) by
ELISA. Western blot analysis of the Abs also will be performed using OMV subjected to SDS-PAGE to reveal
the predominant Ag bands detected by these Abs.

e For the i.vag.-immunized mice, the iliac lymph nodes (ILN) will be excised from i.vag.-immunized mice
to assess T cell responses in the genital tract-draining lymph nodes. In some instances, the mice will
be euthanized after immunization and prior to challenge

e For the i.n.-immunized mice, we will instead use the superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes (CLN)
which drain the nasal lymphoid tissues (NALT) (30-32). T cell responses will be assessed by: (a)
intracellular staining and flow cytometry of ILN or CLN cells (co-stained for surface markers including
CD4 and CD8) for the production of cytokines ex vivo (IFNy, IL-4, and IL-17); (b) culture of ILN or CLN
cells preloaded with carboxyfluorescein succinimide ester (CFSE) with or without gonococcal Ag (OMV)
for 4 days followed by staining for surface markers (CD4 and CD8) and flow cytometry to assess
proliferation by attenuation of CFSE staining (secreted cytokines can also be assayed by ELISA); and
(c) RT-PCR assay of MRNA extracted from ILN or CLN cells for the key Thi, Th2, and Th17
transcription factors Tbet, GATA3, and RORyt, respectively.

Differences in the quantitative responses shown by different groups of mice will be analyzed statistically using
Student’s t tests (for 2 groups) or ANOVA (for multiple groups). All of these experimental and statistical
methods have been used in our previous studies (14, 16-18).

Outcomes, potential difficulties, further experiments/alternatives, and significance/interpretation for
Task 1A:

The primary objectives are to determine: 1) whether i.n. immunization with GvaX12° is as effective as i.vag.
immunization in protection against i.vag. challenge with N. gonorrhoeae; and 2) whether similar immune
responses are induced by these two routes. If i.n. immunization is effective, we would expect it to be
associated with similar immune responses (i.e., anti-gonococcal Abs in serum and vaginal wash, and IFNy-
secreting CD4+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes). Evaluation of salivary IgA Ab responses would reveal the
induction of a common mucosal immune response, which would be expected for i.n. immunization, but not for
i.vag. immunization, because the genital tract does not contain the mucosal inductive site tissues found in the
nasal passages of mice (28, 30). If protection is weak or ineffective, we expect it to be associated with
inadequate immune responses, and in that case we will adjust the dose of vaccine (GvaX12°) given i.n., and/or
the number of doses (e.g., 3 or more doses at 2-week intervals) to increase the immune responses and
generate protection.

An important consideration will be the generation of Ab (IgG and IgA) in vaginal wash after i.n. immunization as
presumably this will be critical for protection. Based on previous experience we expect i.n. immunization to be
at least as effective in generating genital tract Ab responses as i.vag. immunization (25, 28). Discordance
between protection and immune response induction by the two routes would require further investigation, and
possibly provide insight into the mechanisms of protective immunity. If i.n. immunization effectively generates
both protection and immune responses equivalent to i.vag. immunization, we will immunize male mice i.n. with
the same GvaX12® regime to determine if they generate the same serum and salivary Ab responses as female
mice. Although it is not possible to evaluate protective immunity in male mice, a positive result would broaden
the potential applicability of GvaX12° to both sexes.

Given that vaginal IgG Abs are likely derived from the circulation, we will also compare the response to s.c.
immunization with GvaX12° (with appropriate controls) because would expect this route to induce
predominantly serum IgG Ab, as well as vaginal IgG Ab as reported previously (22). If this should be sufficient
to generate protection against gonococcal challenge, it would be important to determine whether a Th1/IFNy
response were also induced, because we previously demonstrated this effect to be essential for protective
immunity (see Phase | data above). However, GvaX12°® is intended for local mucosal, not systemic application,
because systemic release of IL-12 can be toxic. Therefore, an alternative Th1-driving adjuvant for systemic
immunization with OMV may be necessary; however, that possibility is beyond the scope of this application.

We realize that the mouse model cannot fully predict the efficacy of the proposed vaccine in humans, which
can only be determined by means of clinical trials. N. gonorrhoeae is an exclusively human pathogen and non-
human primates are not susceptible to infection, with the exception of chimpanzees (33). However, despite its
limitations the mouse model is the only available animal model for studying the response of an intact
mammalian immune system to N. gonorrhoeae, and we have used it to good effect for this purpose for several
years. Importantly it provides a means to elucidate the type(s) of immune response necessary for protective
immunity against gonococcal infection, and may also identify potential surrogate markers of protection. Thus it
can test hypotheses that cannot be tested in humans and help to frame the questions that will need to be
addressed in humans.

Task 1B: Determine the basis of cross-protective immunity against antigenically diverse clinical
isolates of N. gonorrhoeae

We have found that i.vag. immunization with GvaX12° containing OMV derived from any of three widely used
“laboratory strains” (FA1090, MS11, and FA19) induces protection against challenge, not only against the
homologous strain, but also against each other, despite their known antigenic differences (see above). In
addition, serum and vaginal Ab showed strong cross-reactivity in ELISA against heterologous gonococcal
strains (see above). Although these findings were wholly unexpected, they have been repeatedly reproduced.
However, the extent to which these extensively subcultured strains are representative of naturally circulating N.
gonorrhoeae strains is uncertain. Therefore, to further investigate these findings we will determine whether Ab
cross-reactivity and associated cross-protection against challenge extends to antigenically diverse, minimally
passaged Clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae (in collaboration with Dr. Marcia Hobbs, University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill; letter attached).

Our preliminary findings showed: 1) that immunization of mice i.vag. with GvaX12°® containing OMV prepared
from strain FA1090 also protects against subsequent challenge (with two minimally passaged clinical isolates
provided by Dr. Hobbs): and 2) that serum and vaginal Ab react in ELISA with these isolates, similar to what
we observed with heterologous lab strains (data not shown). Although we can extend these experiments to
include additional clinical isolates, the time and effort involved in such an extension would severely limit the
number of strains that could be tested. Therefore we propose the following process:

1. First, we will perform screening assays by ELISA on a larger number (at least 30) of clinical isolates
from diverse geographic locations in order to determine whether serum and vaginal Abs induced by
immunization of mice with OMV from the laboratory strains cross-react with these clinical isolates in
comparison to the homologous strains. For this purpose, we will immunize mice i.vag. with GvaX12°
containing OMV prepared from gonococcal strains FA1090, MS11, and FA19 (at least 20 mice each),
as described in Aim 1A above, and collect serum and vaginal wash 2 weeks after the last dose.
Terminal bleeding (from the inferior vena cava or subclavian vein) of the mice will be performed under
anesthesia in order to obtain as much serum as possible. Samples will be pooled to yield 5-10ml of
pooled serum and 20ml or more of vaginal wash. Because this is a screening procedure and we
already know that control immunizations are not protective and do not induce Ab, control serum and
vaginal wash will be obtained from unimmunized mice. ELISA plates will then be coated with whole
cells of N. gonorrhoeae, including strains FA1090, MS11, and FA19 as well as the clinical isolates,
freshly grown overnight on “chocolate agar” plates incubated at 37°C in 5% COs as described
previously. Concentrations of gonococci in each harvested culture will be adjusted to the same level by
OD at 600nm. The pooled serum and vaginal wash from immunized and control mice will be serially
diluted and incubated on the plates in quadruplicate for 4-6 hours. Bound antibodies will be detected by

incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG or anti-lgA reagents (Southern
Biotechnology), followed by appropriate substrate development.

2. We will then perform western blots to identify gonococcal Ag bands detected by the Abs. For this
purpose small-scale OMV preparations will be made from each isolate (by shearing cell suspensions in
lithium acetate buffer and applying differential centrifugation as we have done previously (13), their
protein concentrations will be determined by the Pierce bicinchoninic acid method (34). OMV (10-50ug
protein) will be boiled in SDS sample buffer (with 2-mercaptoethanol), separated on SDS-
polyacrylamide (10%) gels, blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with suitably diluted serum
or vaginal wash pools from immunized or control mice. Bound Ab will be detected using peroxidase-
conjugated anti-IgG or anti-IlgA reagents and chemiluminescence. A replicate gel will be stained with
Coomassie blue to reveal the protein bands. Pre-stained MW markers will be included on each gel.

3. We will then test selected clinical isolates (up to 6, chosen at random, to include strains that do not
react with the Ab in immunized mouse serum or vaginal wash, if any) in challenge-protection
experiments. For this purpose, 2 groups (A and B) of 12 mice will be immunized i.vag. with GvaX12®
containing OMV from strains FA1090, MS11 or FA19, as described above (Aim 1A). Two control
groups (C and D) of 12 mice will be unimmunized. One month after immunization, one immunized and
one control group (A and C) will be challenged i.vag. with the selected clinical isolate (transformed to be
streptomycin-resistant by Dr. Hobbs), and the other two groups (B and D) will be challenged with the
immunizing strain (FA1090/MS11/FA19). The course of infection will be monitored by vaginal swabbing
and plating as described above. The recovery of gonococcal CFU and the numbers of mice remaining
infected will be analyzed statistically by 2-way ANOVA and Kaplan-Meier methods, respectively, as
described above. Each experiment will be repeated to verify the result.

Outcomes, potential difficulties, further experiments/alternatives, and significance/interpretation for
Task 1B

We will first relate the ability of clinical isolates to react in ELISA with Ab in serum and vaginal washes of i.vag.-
immunized mice to their porin and Opa types as determined by Dr. Hobbs. On the basis of limited information
pertaining to the laboratory strains (FA1090, MS11, and FA19 are known to express different porB and opa
genes), we do not expect to find any close concordance, but given that porin and Opa are major surface
proteins, this will be examined. Examination of the sera and vaginal wash by western blots against OMV
proteins should confirm lack of reactivity against bands corresponding to porin and Opa proteins, as noted
already for FA1090, MS11, and FA19. However, caution is warranted because protein Ags are denatured in
SDS-PAGE and may not be fully restored on blotting to nitrocellulose membranes, therefore any Ab reactive
with them could be missed. An alternative approach would be to separate OMV proteins in non-denaturing
gels for blotting; however the MW of the protein bands cannot be readily assigned and identification of the
porin and Opa bands would be uncertain. It is also possible that the culture conditions used to prepare OMV,
both for immunization and for Ab analysis, will affect the expression of various Ags, e.g., those regulated by
iron or anaerobiosis. Thus it is important to grow N. gonorrhoeae under standard conditions; however, these
conditions can be altered in light of findings to determine if, for instance, Ags selectively expressed under iron-
limited or anaerobic conditions are relevant.

It is possible that Abs against lipooligosaccharide (LOS) contribute to protective immunity. Interest currently
focuses on the 2C7 epitope which is expressed by >95% of clinical isolates under phase-variable control (35,
36). We will check the expression of 2C7 in the various strains of N. gonorrhoeae, using 2C7 Ab obtained from
Dr. Peter Rice (University of Massachusetts; letter attached), to determine whether protective immunity and Ab
reactivity accord with its expression. Otherwise, determining LOS type and structure is beyond the scope of
the current proposal, and would require further collaborations with those who have the necessary expertise.

The more important question is whether i.vag. immunization with OMV from the laboratory strains induces
protection against naturally occurring strains of N. gonorrhoeae. Although this question cannot be
comprehensively assessed within this proposal, we will determine whether protection is shown against at least
6 randomly chosen clinical isolates, including any that do not recognize Ab in ELISA and/or western blot
assays. If protection is dependent on vaccine-induced Ab that recognize the challenge strain, then any clinical
isolates that fail to react with Ab should not be protected against, and a finding to the contrary would challenge
the hypothesis. Conversely, if strains are found that are not protected against despite recognizing vaccine-
induced Ab, this would negate the hypothesis that these Ab determine protective immunity. If we are to go

Research Strategy Page 86

Contact PD/PI: Liu, Yingru

forward with a vaccine based on gonococcal OMV it will be important to know if there is a frequent occurrence
of strains that are not protected against. If so, then a broader-based vaccine, perhaps incorporating OMV from
multiple strains, or including selected additional Ags (as in the recently introduced 4CMenB vaccine against N.
meningitidis) would become necessary.

If in Aim 1A it is found that i.n. immunization with GvaX12° results in protective immunity against homologous
challenge (similar to that found with i.vag. immunization) and generates Ab (as detected by ELISA and western
blotting against the homologous strain) it will be important to determine: 1) whether these Ab also recognize Ag
in the clinical isolates; and 2) whether protective immunity against them is induced by this route of
immunization. It is possible that different patterns of Ab reactivity may be induced by the two routes (because
the nasal passages contain organized lymphoid tissue where mucosal immune responses are initiated,
whereas such tissues are absent from the genital tract (30, 37)). If so, these differences could help elucidate
the contribution of different Ab specificities to gonococcal immunity.

Task 1C: To determine whether immunization with GvaX12° containing detergent-extracted OMV
induces protective immune responses against N. gonorrhoeae

A potential disadvantage of native OMV as a vaccine immunogen arises from reactogenicity caused by the
presence of LOS. This effect has been observed with meningococcal OMV vaccines that are administered
parenterally, although the mucosal routes of administration that we propose for our gonococcal OMV vaccine
might prove less reactogenic. However, to forestall this potential problem, we will evaluate the ability of
detergent-extracted gonococcal OMV (deOMV) to induce protection against N. gonorrhoeae, and to induce
responses similar to those observed with native OMV.

For this purpose, we will modify our standard OMV (FA1090) preparation by extraction with 1% sodium
deoxycholate in 1mM EDTA, 0.1M Tris buffer pH 8.5, followed by chromatography on a size-exclusion column
(38). Mice will be immunized i.vag. with 2 doses (2-week interval) of GvaX12°® containing deOMV (50g
protein) as described above. Control mice will be immunized with deOMV plus blank particles, and a
comparison group of mice will be immunized with GvaX12° containing native OMV. Samples of serum and
vaginal wash will be collected at 2 weeks after immunization for Ab assay. One month later mice will be
challenged with N. gonorrhoeae FA1090, and the course of infection will be monitored by vaginal swabbing
and plating, as described above. Further samples of serum, vaginal wash, and ILN will be collected at
termination, for evaluation of Ab and cytokine responses, as described above.

We will compare protection against challenge, as well as Ab and cytokine responses induced by immunization
with deOMV plus IL-12 particles with those induced by native OMV plus IL-12 particles, and with those induced
by deOMV administered with blank particles. If the response to deOMV plus IL-12 particles is significantly less
than that induced by native OMV plus IL-12 particles, we will repeat the experiment using increased doses of
deOMV (e.g., 100-200ug protein), or by administering 3 or more immunizations. If i.n. immunization is
successful with native OMV (Aim 1A above), we will further determine whether it works with deOMV.

Outcomes and significance for Task 1C

No difficulty is expected in performing experiments to evaluate the efficacy of deOMV as a vaccine immunogen
in comparison with native OMV. On the basis of reports that meningococcal deOMV are less immunogenic
than native OMV (attributed to the reduced LOS content), we may find that gonococcal deOMV are also less
immunogenic; if so, we will determine whether increased dose or frequency of immunization can compensate
adequately. The significance of successful results with deOMV may lie with diminished toxicity as revealed by
the studies proposed in Aim 2 below

3.2.2 Specific Aim 2: Conduct studies of Rodent pharmacokinetics and reproductive toxicology
A. Task 2A: determine the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of IL-12 following intravaginal and
intranasal administration of GvaX12°in mice.

The objective of this study is to gain insight into the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and potential acute
toxicity of IL-12 following a single i.vag. or intranasal (i.n.) administration of GvaX12° or as a bolus intravenous
(i.v.) dose of IL-12 to female mice. The study design is as follows:

ruffled fur, lethargy, loss of appetite, cool to touch), body weights, and toxicokinetic parameters (see below).
Samples will be collected according to the following table:

Blood will be collected into serum separation tubes (SST) tubes by saphenous vein puncture (target of 0.1 mL)
or via the abdominal aorta (maximum possible volume) while under isoflurane anesthesia (terminal samples
only). An additional terminal blood sample (target volume up to 1 mL) will be collected of 1 spare animal and
used as a pre-dose sample. Samples will be frozen immediately over dry ice and transferred to a freezer set to
maintain -20°C until use. Levels of IL-12 will be measured by ELISA. Tmax, (time of maximum serum
concentration), Ty, (half-life), Cmax (maximum serum concentration), Cmayvo (maximum serum concentration
divided by dose) and AUC (area under the curve) will be calculated. Levels of other pro and anti-inflammatory
cytokines (e.g., IFNy, TNFa, IL-10 and TGFB) will also be measured.

Outcomes, potential difficulties, alternatives and significance For Task 2A

The primary outcome measure for the pharmacokinetic study will be the circulating level of IL-12 over time,
according to the schedule in Table 2. Secondary measures include circulating levels of IFNy. The absolute
bioavailability will be calculated using the dose-corrected area under curve (AUC) for non-intravenous
administration divided by the AUC for intravenous administration, according to classical pharmacology
modeling. However, based on our previous experience we do not expect significant systemic exposure of IL-12
by either the i.n. or i.vag. route. Because the generation of IFNy is a well-known effect of IL-12, we expect
systemic IL-12 exposure also will result in increased IFNy. The results will inform starting doses for
subsequent IND enabling non-clinical studies in rodents.

No technical difficulties are anticipated in the performance of these studies. All the methods are in place and
have been used previously. Extensive experience with GvaX12® administered i.vag. in doses up to 2ug of
cytokine per mouse given at 2-day intervals for up to 5 doses, revealed no adverse effects. Whether similar
doses given intranasally will result in adverse or toxic effects is unknown. GvaX12°® is not designed for
intravenous administration; however, standard pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations require
comparisons with this route. Mice will be inspected at least twice daily for the following signs: hunched posture,
ruffled fur, lethargy, loss of appetite, coolness to touch, and body weight. Animals displaying signs of distress
after GvaX12° administration will be reported and monitored closely. A combination of 2 or more signs without
evidence of recovery within 12h, or >10% loss of body weight, will be recorded as adverse reaction and the
affected animals will be euthanized.

B. Reproductive toxicology studies in rats.

IL-12 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Because the proposed vaccine may be used in women of child-bearing
age, reproductive toxicity is a concern. Therefore, early reproductive toxicology testing is proposed. Studies,
including a GLP embryo-fetal development study and a study for effects on pre- and post-natal development in
rats will be conducted at Comparative Biosciences. Complete study designs can be found in Appendix 1. If the
in. route is found to be effective, reproductive toxicology will be delayed until our type C meeting (see below).

Outcomes, potential difficulties, and alternatives for Task 2B

GvaX12°® might induce untoward effects at the proposed dose levels. However, a major goal of encapsulation
is to limit systemic exposure and side effects. Therefore, we believe such a finding is unlikely. However,
significant reproductive toxicity would trigger a no-go decision for the continued development of this product.
We have identified several back-up drug substances as substitute for IL-12 (e.g., anti-IL-10 antibody), which
are under development separately.

3.2.3 Specific Aim 3: To prepare and submit a briefing package, written questions and formal request for a
pre-pre-IND (Type C) meeting with the FDA

The successful accomplishment of Aims 1 and 2 will incentivize and prioritize the development of our
prophylactic gonorrhea vaccine. The early input of the FDA will be invaluable in guiding our IND enabling
scale-up and toxicology study designs. Regulatory Professionals is already assisting TherapyX' in the
preparation and submission of GvaX12® IND-related materials. The master services agreement and SOW
related to the proposed studies is included in Appendix 2. The consultants at Regulatory Professionals have
extensive expertise in the preparation of briefing packages, meeting requests, clinical (IND) and marketing
applications for various drug formulations, including biologics and polymeric drug delivery systems. A briefing
package and meeting request will be prepared and submitted along with specific questions in the areas of
clinical, nonclinical, and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC). The aim is to confirm FDA requirements
for data to support Phase I/II clinical studies, primarily with respect to safety. Ultimately, the questions will be
determined by the data collected from the studies conducted in Aims 1 and 2 and by our discussion with
toxicology consultants at Regulatory Professionals.

Outcomes, potential difficulties, and significance

The FDA encourages investigators to initiate contact with the agency as early in the drug development process
as possible. The stated goal is to allow investigators the opportunity to consider FDA recommendations in
planning preclinical and clinical development programs. TherapyX"® has recently completed a pre-pre-IND
(Type C) meeting with the FDA for a separate project involving oral administration of TGFB-loaded particles
(TGFBNanoCap®). The preparation for this meeting included the creation of a briefing package which included
specific questions requesting the FDA’s opinion of the company’s proposed Non-Clinical (toxicology), Quality
(CMC), and Clinical (early clinical trial design) study plans. We expect that the preparation of the briefing
package for this program will follow the same developmental path. If circumstances dictate, additional
consulting expertise can be obtained. We do not expect there to be any difficulties that cannot be overcome
with the assembled team of advisors.
