| LIABILITY IN THE DELIVERY OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE:
DRIVER, IMPEDIMENT, OR BOTH?
SPEGIFIC AIMS
Personalized medicine (PM) is widely expected to transform medicine and the health care systern over the
next decade. Yet, the emergence and implementation of PM has been slower than many anticipated. Scientific
complexity and uncertainties, the need for validation of biomarkers, commercial unavailability of relevant
diagnostic tests, economic costs, lack of reimbursement for diagnostic testing, regulatory approval barriers,
structural problems in the existing health care delivery system, inadequate business models, physician
educational gaps and resistance, and intellectual property issues have all been identified as potential factors
impeding the implementation of PM. One factor that has not been subject to much attention to date, but is likely
to play an increasingly significant role in the future, is the potential for liability. In particular, physicians, a key
| gatekeeper in the uptake in PM, are most at risk of liability relating to PM due to their lack of available
defenses, limited training in genetics, and legal doctrinal trends that will be further evaluated in this project.
Indeed, the first PM lawsuits are already being pursued in the courts, and a rapid ramp-up of such litigation can
be expected over the next few years, particularly if some of the initial lawsuits are successful. Uncertainties
about the benefits, costs and standards for applying PM technologies and tests will further clinical adoption of
some PM technologies and practices, while potentially deterring others, affecting the availability, safety and
benefits of PM innovations for patients. Notwithstanding the major role that liability risks and uncertainties are
likely to play in the implementation and direction of PM, relatively little doctrinal, empirical or policy research
has been conducted on this issue to date.
This project proposes to examine the nature and risks of potential PM-related liability for physicians, the key
doctrinal and evidentiary issues that will determine the potential likelihood and success of such lawsuits, the
likely impacts of liability risks on the development and direction of PM, and potential policy tools to better
manage liability risks and uncertainties. It will then seek to communicate the findings and implications of our
research to key stakeholder groups. Specifically, this project aims to:

1. Identify the legal claims, defenses and doctrines, including current trends and changes in these key
legal criteria, that will affect liability for physicians relating to PM;

2. Evaluate the risks of PM-related liability to physicians by integrating the doctrinal analysis with the fact
patterns in four likely PM case studies, as well as by analyzing lessons from previous examples of
physician liability relating to new medical technologies and procedures;

3. Explore the potential impacts of physician liability on the development and direction of PM, including
physician practices and patient access to and benefit from PM;

4. Identify and evaluate potential policy options for better management of physician liability risks and
uncertainties relating to PM; and

5. Conduct outreach on the findings and implications of our research to key stakeholder groups (including
physicians, physician educators, patient groups, and legal practitioners (including judges}) to help them
better prepare for and anticipate future liability trends and impacts.
