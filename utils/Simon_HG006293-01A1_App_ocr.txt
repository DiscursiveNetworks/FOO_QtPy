Interactive Multimedia and Biorepository Informed Consent

The long-term goal of this research is to develop multimedia technology and interactive
instructional strategies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of obtaining informed consent
for human DNA and tissue biorepositories. Studies suggest that individuals do not sufficiently
understand the information presented during biorepository consent processes, and that
traditional consent processes pose resource challenges for large-scale biorepositories. Based
on experiments testing multimedia presentations for patient education purposes, multimedia has
the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of obtaining biorepository informed
consent by increasing participant understanding and recollection of information presented. Yet,
this potential has not been systematically investigated in the unique context of biorepository
consent. In particular, there is a need to understand the separate effects of interactivity (i.e.,
question asking, feedback provided to subjects) and multimedia {i.e., multiple information
delivery formats) on participant knowledge, understanding, and decision to participate.

This study will compare a standard paper-based consent process (control) to multimedia
and interactive consent processes, using an experimental design with random assignment,
integrated into actual recruitment at the University of lowa Hospitals and Clinics’ (UIHC)
comprehensive DNA and tissue biorepository. To assess the separate effects of interactivity and
multimedia, low and high interactivity conditions will be tested for both the paper and the
multimedia conditions. In the high interactivity conditions, participants will be asked questions
about the information presented and provided feedback on their responses. Interactivity and
multimedia are expected to significantly improve subject knowledge and understanding when
compared to the paper-based control. High interactive multimedia is expected to decrease staff
time devoted to obtaining informed consent. Two hundred (200) patients will participate in the
study from the Dermatology and Immunology/Rheumatology Clinics at the UIHC. Participants
will be enrolled into the UIHC biorepository via one of the four study conditions. Results of the
study will be used to develop a multisite comparative study designed to demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of interactivity and multimedia consent under different
environments, forms of media, and informed consent protocols. This research has the potential
to improve on current paper-based informed consent processes and to establish the feasibility
of alternative, and more effective, multimedia consent processes for human DNA and tissue
biorepositories and other research-driven efforts in genetics and genomics.

Interactive Multimedia and Biorepository Informed Consent

Biorepositories may ask thousands of people a year to donate biological samples, allow
access to their health information, and participate in research. Yet, there is little research
on the best ways to deliver informed consent information to individuals so that they can
make an informed decision about participating in biorepositories. This study will test an
interactive, multimedia tool for delivering informed consent information about
biorepositories to individuals in an understandable and effective way.

Klein's pilot study (Interactive, Multimedia Informed Consent Pilot Study); thus, she is very familiar with the
development of modules, instruments and the data collection process. In collaboration with Dr. Klein, Dr. Smith
will assist in the development of the multimedia modules and the interactivity component of the high
interactivity, paper-based process. She will conduct the pilot testing of the modules with volunteers and assist
with the formative review. She will develop the training materials for the research assistants. During the
beginning of the data collection process, she will support Ms. L'Heureux in the training of clinic staff;
supporting the clinic staff in the conduct of the experiment; setting up the computers for running subjects;
retrieving paperwork from clinic personnel on a case-by-case basis; and checking the data for completeness.

Research Assistants (TBD) Currently, the UIHC biorepository utilizes research assistants to recruit
participants. Two research assistants in the first year and four additional assistants in the second year will be
trained on integration of the study into the current, IRB-approved biorepository informed consent process. By
integrating the study into the biorepository recruitment process, experiment duties will be added to the
research assistants’ current obligations (¢.g., informed consent for the experiment, random assignment of
participants to a biorepository informed consent condition, high interactivity component for high interactivity,
paper-based process, administration of experiment questionnaire on knowledge and demographics, tracking
time spent with each participant, etc.) Therefore, the budget proposal includes 7 hours of experiment training
per research assistant and up to 45 minutes of research assistants’ time per research participant (for a total
study sample of 200 participants, with flexibility to oversample by an additional 20 participants) for the duration
of data collection.

Year 1 7 hours of training for two research assistants; data collection for approximately 50 participants
at 45 minutes/participant

Year 2 7 hours of training tor four additional research assistants; data collection for approximately 150
participants at 45 minutes/participant

INTRODUCTION TO RESUBMISSION

Responses to the Resume and individual Critiques (C) are summarized below. Ma-
jor changes include a substantively reworked Significance (S}, innovation (1) and

cause of its broad assessment of outcomes. Summary weaknesses were 1. fack Of | Environment
thorough review of other multimedia (m-media} tools. An expert (D. Klein) in m-
media and computer-based instruction wrote the original, extensive review of the literature in this field. We
have added to the review of m-media tools, including details on tools being used at Marshfield and Mayo bio-
repositories (see A7 in /&A). Total m-media related citations now number 42. 2. greater detail needed on spe-
cifics of proposed m-media tool. We clarified the structure and content of the m-media tool and integrated a
visual exemplar (see R2 in A). 3. A minor weakness was need to evaluate barriers to tool adoption. We in-
cluded a senior consultant (M. Brilliant, MD, Marshfield Clinic) to help identify potential adoption barriers. We
also secured financial support from our CTSA (see Rosenthal letter) for a summative workshop to plan for
adoption barriers, strategize data dissemination, and outline a collaborative (lowa/Mayo/Marshfield) R01 for
evaluating and testing a composite m-media tool in a randomized way (see R3 in A, “Future Directions’).
IMPACT: Critique 1 (C1): lack of aggressive exploration of other m-media tools leaves unique contribution of
study unclear. We reworked the literature review (see above) and reorganized /nnovation to highlight the sepa-
ration of interactivity and m-media as a leading innovative element of our study (see R1 in / & A). We added
pilot data to support our study hypotheses and claims to innovation (see R8, “Preliminary Data” in A). C1: fittle
detail about parameters of m-media too! provided (see response in Resume, above). C1: omission of return of
results issues disappointing. We integrated a focus on return of results (see R4 in S & /) and modified study
instruments accordingly {see Appendix, “Questionnaire’).

SIGNIFICANCE: C1 and C3: actual biorepository candidates/focus on decision to consent would add value.
We secured Institutional Review Board {IRB) support (see Bertolaius fetter) for integrating the study into the
biorepository recruitment process. The study will measure actual, rather than simulated, behavior, exploring
possible relationships between participant comprehension and decision to participate (see R5 in Aims, | & A).
INVESTIGATORS: The investigators were considered well qualified and no weaknesses were noted.
INNOVATION: C7: overall idea of creating and evaluating m-media presentations for consent is not so innova-
tive. We clarified that m-media has been used to improve consent, including among some biorepositories, but
that no efforts have controlled for separate and combined effects of interactivity and m-media (see AT in! & A).
Pilot data we collected (see A, “Preliminary Data’) suggest that interactivity and m-media enhance each other's
effectiveness, but do not reveal their separate contributions, thus supporting need for this research {see A7 in
/). Where the original application included an extensive review of theory-based research of m-media in /nnova-
fion, we moved the bulk of the theory to Approach (see R6 in A). We also clarified that efficiency and return of
results, both of which this study addresses, are understudied variables in m-media/consent research.
APPROACH: C7 and C3: study lacks outcome measure for decision to participate in biorepository. This meas-
ure is now included (see R7 in S, | & Appendix, Decision to Participate in Biobank Form). C1: Have many re-
sources available through m-media arm. Where adding content may improve the experience of participants, for
this feasibility study we chose to control for content, using only IRB-approved content in all arms. Our pilot data
indicated that m-media content was well received (See R8 in A). C7: do not adequately address downside of
becoming “more efficient” by reducing human element. We clarified that consent efficiency/human element of
consent is a key but complex issue, allowing for only limited consideration of a core efficiency metric, staff time,
and added citations to support this point. We included pilot data to demonstrate that use of m-media consent
tools are not onerous to participants. We broadened measurement ot staff time to all 4 conditions (previously
restricted to high-interactivity conditions) (R9 in Aims, | & A). C1: Collection/scoring of outcome data should be
conducted by blinded staff. Blinding recruiters is not possible because they are administering the conditions.
However, nearly all questionnaire data are numeric, except for a few open-ended questions, and therefore not
subject to bias (see Appenaix, “Participant Questionnaire’). Data will also be collected with recruiters out of the
room. C3: study lacks consideration of literacy issues/effect on intervention. We cited this as a limitation of the
study, and have included plans to address literacy issues in future (R01) research {see R10 in A, “Limitations’).
ENVIRONMENT: The environment was adequate and no weaknesses were noted.

HUMAN SUBJECTS: The plan for protecting human subjects was acceptable, steps have been taken to ac-
count for the integrated nature of the revised study design (see revised Protection of Human Subjects).

Specific Aims

The long-term goal of this research is to use multimedia technology and interactive instructional
strategies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of obtaining informed consent for human DNA and tissue
biorepositories. Using an experimental design with random assignment [R5 integrated into actual recruitment
for a biorepository /R5], we expect interactivity and multimedia to significantly improve subject knowledge and
understanding and multimedia to decrease staff time devoted to obtaining consent, when compared to a
standard, paper-based informed consent process (e.g., control group}. Studies suggest that many individuals
do not sufficiently understand the information presented during informed consent processes, and that
traditional informed consent processes pose resource-related challenges for large-scale biorepositories.

This study will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating interactivity and multimedia to efficiently
enhance and standardize biorepository consent processes. Biorepository consent must address a spectrum of
issues, including the nature, purpose, future use, and potential risks and benefits of participating in tissue and
DNA biorepositories, as well as the prospect of returning research results and confidentiality issues. Using a
theory-driven approach based on principles of human learning and cognition, the study will compare a
standard, IRB (Institutional Review Board) approved paper-based consent process (control) to interactive and
multimedia consent processes. The multimedia consent process will present information using multiple media
{text, audio, relevant graphics, and content specific, simple animations). To demonstrate the effects of
interactivity, separate from multimedia, low and high interactivity conditions will be tested for both the paper
and the multimedia conditions. In the high interactivity conditions, participants will be asked questions about
the information presented and provided feedback on their responses to enhance understanding and correct
misunderstanding. A formative evaluation of the interactive and multimedia consent processes will precede the
experiment and include input from a bioethics expert, a genomics researcher and biorepository director, an IRB
Chair, a genetic counselor, researchers at other biorepositories, and a panel of community representatives.

The informed consent processes will be tested in a four group experimental design with (1} the current,
IRB-approved standard, paper-based informed consent (low interactivity) as the control (PBLI), compared to
{2) paper-based with high interactivity (PBHI), (3) multimedia with low interactivity (MMLI), and (4) multimedia
with high interactivity (MMHI). [R5 The study will be integrated into the current, IRB-approved informed consent
process for the comprehensive DNA and tissue biorepository at the University of lowa Hospitals and Clinics
{UIHC). Two hundred (200) patients being seen at the UIHC Dermatology (n=100) and Immunology/
Rheumatology (n=100) Clinics, which are currently enrolling patients into the UIHC Biorepository, will
participate in the study. /R5) Participants will be enrolled into the UIHC Biorepository via one of the four study
conditions. Results of the study will be used to develop a multisite comparative study designed to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of interactive and multimedia consent under different environments, forms of
media, and informed consent protocols. This research has the potential to improve on current paper-based
informed consent processes and to establish the feasibility of alternative, and more effective, multimedia
consent processes for human DNA and tissue biorepositories and other research-driven efforts in qenetics and
genomics.

Specific Aim: Systematically develop and test the use of multimedia and interactivity to (1) improve participant
knowledge and understanding and (2) reduce staff time devoted to obtaining informed consent, using
an experiment with random assignment of participants integrated into live recruitment processes for a
biorepository.

Hypothesis 1: Multimedia Will Result in Improved Participant Knowledge and Understanding — Participants
learning about informed consent from multimedia (MMHI and MMLI) will demonstrate better knowledge
and understanding of biorepository consent information, compared to participants in the paper-based
(PBLI and PBHI} conditions.

Hypothesis 2: Interactivity Will Result in Improved Participant Knowledge and Understanding — Participants in
the high interactivity conditions (MMHI & PBHI) will demonstrate better knowledge and understanding,
compared to participants in the low interactivity conditions (MMLI & PBLI).

Hypothesis 3: Multimedia Will Result in Reduced Staff Time for Informed Consent — [R9 Staff time will be
lower in the multimedia (MMHI & MHLI) conditions, when compared to the paper-based (PBHI & PBLI)
conditions. /R9]

Research Strategy - Significance of the Proposed Work

This proposal addresses an NHGRI recognized and critical need to improve the obtaining of informed
consent for genomics research, including biorepository-based genomics research, involving human
participants, biospecimens, and health information (Green & Guyer, 2011; Fabsitz et al., 2010; McGuire &
Beskow, 2010; Miller et al., 2008). Researchers and institutional review boards have been urged to pay careful
attention to the need to obtain informed consent from genomics research participants (Mehlman, 2001; Rotimi
& Marshall, 2010). Genomics research challenges standard approaches to informed consent because of the
broad utility and sharing of research data beyond any immediate studies; [R4 the potential for returning
incidental findings and other types of research results /R4]; concerns that participants may have about
confidentiality and discrimination; issues with respect to data sharing and re-consent; and the substantial
resources that are needed to approach and consent large numbers of participants (Green & Guyer, 2011;
McCarty et al., 2011a; Ormond et al., 2010; Parker, 2008; Pulley et al., 2010; Simon et al., 2011). Members of
the public are concerned about the time-consuming and potentially confusing nature of traditional consent
processes for biorepositories (Murphy et al., 2009; Simon et al. 2011). Research indicates that participants
have emerged from traditional consent processes with misperceptions about the potential risks and benefits of
biorepository participation, biospecimen ownership, and the voluntary nature of participation (Allen &
McNamara, 2011; Barr, 2006; Maradiaga & Maultsby, 2011; Neidich et al., 2008; Ormond et al., 2009;
Toccaceli et al., 2009). Recent court cases demonstrate the potential consequences of these misperceptions
for researchers and institutions, including disruption of research, financial settlements, and destruction of
samples (Beleno v. Tex. Dept. of State Health Servs., 2009; Harmon, 2010; Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board
of Regents, 2008; Trinidad et al., 2011}. These consequences impede scientific advances which could
contribute to improving the health of individuals (Trinidad et al., 2011).

Although no single solution will address all the needs, we propose to use multimedia technology and
interactive instructional strategies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of informed consent processes
for biorepositories. [R1 Preliminary research suggests that multimedia presentations are feasible for obtaining
informed consent from potential biorepository donors (McCarty et al., 2011b; K. Yost, personal communication,
May 16, 2011}. /R1] By comparing interactivity and multimedia as separate constructs to traditional, paper-
based processes for consenting individuals into a comprehensive DNA and tissue biorepository, the research
will demonstrate the individual and combined effects of these strategies on participant knowledge of and staff
time tor R5. [obtaining informed consent in an actual (not a simulated) recruitment process]. Where multimedia
has potential advantages for standardizing the process, interactivity could be implemented with its own
advantages into paper-based approaches without the added cost of multimedia production. [R7 Individuals will
be randomly assigned and formally consented to the biorepository through one of four conditions, allowing
comparison of actual decisions to participate in the biorepository by informed consent condition. /R7] This
project is significant, therefore, because it tests a technology-based solution with potential to diminish the
challenges of conducting informed consent for tissue and DNA biorepositories. By identifying the individual and
combined effects of interactivity and multimedia, the project will provide empirical evidence for theory-based
best practices that DNA and tissue biorepositories can implement to improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of obtaining informed consent from potential biospecimen donors.

Research Strategy - Innovation of the Proposed Work

[R1. Although multimedia has been applied to informed consent for research (Cohn & Larson, 2007; Flory &
Emanuel, 2004; Henry et al., 2009; Jeste et al., 2008), and a few biorepositories are experimenting with
multimedia approaches for informed consent (e.g., McCarty et al., 2011b; K. Yost, personal communication
{p.c.), May 16, 2011), the proposed research integrates a number of original and important design elements:

1. An experimental approach that controls for interactivity and multimedia in an actual biorepository
recruitment context. Most studies of informed consent described as multimedia have failed to contro! for the
effects of interactivity. In Flory and Emanuel’s (2004) review of multimedia consent research, most multimedia
were videos or PowerPoint presentations where participants watched and listened to information, but were not
required to interact with or use that information. These design limitations may account for the finding that
multimedia was superior to standard (paper-based) informed consent in only 1 of 12 studies (Flory & Emanuel,
2004). In contrast, multimedia informed consent has been successful in studies of patient education for routine
care {e.g., Jeste et al., 2008; Lewis, 1999; Schenker et al., 2011). In review articles of studies using interactive
“test/feedback” techniques of which a proportion were also multimedia, all studies showed improvement in
patient knowledge of informed consent (Flory & Emanuel, 2004; Schenker et al., 2011}. Interventions in these
studies tested patient knowledge during the learning process and provided corrective feedback.

Several biorepositories are also experimenting with multimedia approaches to informed consent. Users
of the Marshfield Clinic's video consent process accessed via touchscreen reported feeling “well informed” in a
focus group study (McCarty et al., 201 1b) The Mayo Clinic is in the early phases of testing a multimedia
consent process for a disease-specific biobank, in which video is used and participants are prompted to ask for
more information. No evaluation data are available yet on this system (K. Yost, p.c., May 16, 2011}. [R5
Neither the Marshfield nor the Mayo studies control for the separate effects of multimedia and interactivity.
Therefore, our experimental design will investigate the effects of multiple media (text, aucio, graphics and
content specific, simple animations) and interactivity {predefined questions to patients with feedback) as
separate constructs integrated into actual biorepository recruitment.R5] Our pilot data indicate a strong effect
for interactive multimedia as a delivery strategy over paper-based delivery (p = .008), where interactivity and
multimedia appear to enhance each other's effectiveness (see Preliminary Data in Approach). Knowing what
effects interactivity and multimedia respectively have on consent knowledge/understanding will not only permit
multimedia consent tools to be more rationally designed, but demonstrate how interactivity can improve paper-
based consent processes. /R1]

(R92. A focus on informed consent effectiveness and efficiency: The effectiveness of informed consent in
conveying knowledge and understanding of the research is a key component of protecting human subjects’
rights (Beauchamp & Childress, 1979; Lavori et al., 1999; National Commission, 1979). As a result, we plan to
measure informed consent knowledge and understanding as separate but interconnected constructs, using
several measures adapted specifically for the biorepository and UIHC Biorepository contexts (see Appendix,
Participant Questionnaire). However, resources allocation is also an important consideration for large-scale
biorepositories (Pulley et al., 2010). Most emerging studies of informed consent among biorepositories have
focused predominantly on measuring effectiveness or perceived effectiveness {e.g., Allen & McNamara, 2011;
Maradiaga & Maultsby, 2011). Marshfield Clinic's pilot study demonstrating that their multimedia consent took
participants slightly less time than the paper-based process (17.5 vs. 18.25 min.; McCarty et al., 2011b)
speaks to the feasibility of multimedia consent tools from a user perspective. However, research on informed
consent has not considered efficiency from the standpoint of staff time invested in the consent process. While
efficiency in informed consent is a complex construct and raises questions such as whether actual and/or
perceived effectiveness may be compromised as consent efficiency improves and the human element is
decreased (Ellickson & Hawes, 1989), staff time is an important metric of efficiency and budgetary impact of
technology-based consent {Lavori et al., 1999). The study begins the process of examining efficiency
constructs and metrics with those of consent effectiveness in the biorepository informed consent context. /R9]

[R4  3.A timely focus on return of research results: Individual genetic/genomic research results (IGRRs) and
the challenges they pose are a major interest and concern (Bredenoord et al., 2011; Christensen et al., 2011;
Fabsitz et al., 2010; Hens et al., 2011; Kolleck & Petersen, 2011). To our knowledge, no studies have
examined whether multimedia can potentially improve understanding of the prospect of IGRRs. Therefore, our
study and study instruments now accommodate an exploration of the potential effects of interactive multimedia
on knowledge/understanding of the possible return of IGRRs. The UIHC Biorepository’s consent document is
ideal for this purpose because it includes a description of the qualified disclosure policy that the Biorepository
is taking on return of IGRRs (see p. 4, biorepository consent document). This type of policy is likely to be
increasingly adopted as guidelines, consensus statements, and experts advocate for some limited return of
IGRRs (Beskow & Burke 2010; Bredencord et al., 2011; Fabsitz et al., 2010}. We expect that individuals
enrolled in the interactive multimedia condition of our study will understand the UIHC Bio-repository’s
statement on the return of results better than those enrolled in the paper-based conditions. If this expectation is
borne out, our study will help advance in an important and novel direction, interactive multimedia consent,
evolving efforts to convey IGRR disclosure policies to prospective biorepository participants. /R4]

Approach

Introduction. The objective of this project is to systematically develop and test the use of multimedia
and interactivity to improve participant knowledge and understanding and reduce staff time devoted to
obtaining informed consent for biobanking. We will test our working hypotheses using a 2 x 2 randomized,
experimental design incorporated into the current UIHC, IRB-approved biorepository recruitment process, with
delivery type (paper-based versus multimedia) and interactivity {low versus high) as the independent variables;
and knowledge, understanding, decision to enroll in the Biorepository, and staff time as the dependent
measures. Ultimately, the proposed research will provide strategies that biorepositories can use to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of their informed consent processes.

Justification and Feasibility. The informed consent process requires participants to learn about the
research study and use that information to make a decision about participating {Krathwohl, 2002). Traditionally,
a researcher summarizes and/or a participant reads a paper informed consent document. While previous
research has focused on improving participants’ decision making (Kass et al., Mintz et al., and Merz & Sankar
in Agre et al., 2003; Benson et al., 1988), this study aims to improve effectiveness by increasing participant
knowledge acquisition during informed consent so that participants can make an informed decision. Research
on informed consent has often focused on content issues such as decreasing the length of informed consent
documents or simplifying the language (e.g., Beskow et al., 2010; Dresden & Levitt, 2001; Epstein & Lasagna,
1969; Wittenberg & Dickler, 2007) with mixed results (see Wittenberg & Dickler, 2007, for a review). Our study
will focus on improving the delivery and acquisition of consent information using interactive multimedia.

[R1, R6. Using Multimedia to improve Informed Consent. Well-designed multimedia delivery platforms are
theorized to enhance learning because words and pictures are presented simultaneously. Multimedia is a
combination of visual and auditory information such as pictures, animations, recorded words, live words,
sounds, and video (Mayer, 2009; Sims, 1997}. According to dual coding theory (Paivio, 1990), people process
information through two simultaneous pathways, verbal (words and symbols) and spatial (pictures and
movement). By strategically presenting information through both modalities, information is learned more
efficiently and learning is enhanced (Clark & Mayer, 2008; Mayer, 2002, 2009; Mayer & Moreno, 1998;
Mousavi et al., 1995; Sadoski & Paivio, 2001). Multimedia also enhances learning by maintaining cognitive foad
at an optimum level, when designed on principles of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) (Schnotz & Kirschner, 2007;
Sweller et al., 1998; van Merriénboer & Sweller, 2005). Optimal learning engages but does not overwhelm the
learner. Thus, by designing both content and presentation of instruction to optimize load, multimedia instruction
facilitates the control of content and presentation of information (Chandler & Sweller, 1991; Mayer & Moreno,
2003; Paas & van Merriénboer, 1994; Sweller et al., 1998). To manage cognitive load, investigators must focus
on instructional design. By improving the way in which information is presented, participant learning is
expected to improve. Thus, by strategically adding graphics and designing multimedia to manage cognitive
load, we hypothesize (Hypothesis 1) that multimedia will result in improved participant knowledge and
understanding. Participants learning about informed consent from multimedia (MMHI and MMLI) will
demonstrate better knowledge and understanding of biorepository consent information, compared to
participants in the paper-based (PBLI and PBHI) conditions.

Using Interactivity to Improve Participant Understanding. Although many prior studies of informed
consent for medical research refer to interactive multimedia or provide some form of interactivity in their
treatments, interactivity is not explained by a theoretical model and not defined or measured as a separate
construct. Although few studies separate interactivity from other characteristics of multimedia, in studies of
informed consent for medical research, interactive features of multimedia have included conditions where
users control the pace or sequence of the instruction (Campbell et al., 2004; Jeste et al., 2008, 2009;
Llewellyn-Thomas et al., 1995), periodic quizzes (Dunn et al., 2002; Karunaratne et al., 2010; Palmer et al.,
2008}, simulations, such as scenarios or vignettes requiring patient input (Mintz et al. and Merz & Sankar in
Agre et al., 2003), repetition of content after assessment (Dunn et al., 2002), and hyperlinks to support deep
processing of information (Karunaratne et al., 2010; Llewellyn-Thomas et al., 1995).

Although many theories of interactivity have been proposed (Downes & McMillan, 2000; Jensen, 2008;
Kiousis, 2002; McMillan, 2005), for this project, interactivity is the degree to which an individual is 1) asked to
respond or use information and 2) provided with feedback on his responses (Kiousis, 2002; Koolstra & Bos,
2009; Yacci, 2000), in contrast to passive reception of information such as watching a video. This type of
interactivity can be manipulated in any instructional situation (e.g., computer-based or paper-based; Sims,
2003). Prior studies have used two kinds of interactivity, 1) user control and 2} engagement with the
information. This research focuses on engagement with the information as it is more likely to improve
participant learning (Palmer et al., 2008) and, therefore, understanding of consent information.

According to information processing and interactivity theories (Yacci, 2000), interactivity can enhance
learning by making learners actively process information, selecting relevant information, organizing it, and
integrating it into their memory structure (Mayer, 2002). In addition, interactivity can benefit learner
engagement by providing a sense of social presence (Yacci, 2000}, perception of reduced effort (Downes &
McMillan, 2000), or by attracting and maintaining learner attention (Lustria, 2007). Even the expectation of
receiving feedback can improve learning behavior (Vollmeyer & Rheinberg, 2005). /R1, /R6] Because well-
designed interactions can enhance learning, we hypothesize (Hypothesis 2} that interactivity will result in
improved participant knowledge and understanding. Participants in the high interactivity conditions (MMHI &

PBHI) will demonstrate better understanding of the content, compared to those in the low interactivity
conditions (MMLI & PBLI).

improving Efficiency by Reducing Staff Time to Obtain informed Consent. Even if a multimedia consent
process takes as much participant time to complete as paper-based, it can reduce staff time invested in
delivering basic knowledge. Staff need not be present for the entire time that participants view or work with the
multimedia presentation. While efficiency is a complex construct and will ultimately require closer investigation

than this study can allow, we predict (Hypothesis 3) that the multimedia conditions will demonstrate better

efficiency, detined as less staff time devoted to obtaining informed consent, than the paper-based conditions.

[R8 Preliminary Data. A recent pilot study (n = 95) by Schartz and Klein found that participants who
completed interactive, multimedia informed consent in a mock study of a clinical trial reported significantly
better understanding (M = 15.9 correct out of 18 possible multiple-choice questions) and found the process
easier to use (M = 2.32 rating on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 as “excessively easy" and 5 as "excessively
difficult") than those who received paper-based informed consent (M = 14.9 and M = 3.16, respectively;
understanding F{2,92) = 5.10, p = .008, ease of use F{(2, 93) = 7.29, p = .001). The mean for multimedia
without interactivity fell between the two (M = 15.2, M= 2.77, respectively). Although the interactive,
multimedia condition (M = 20.7 min.) took approximately 2 more minutes than the paper-based (M = 18.7 min.)
to complete, participants in the interactive, multimedia condition perceived that it took less time than those in
the control condition (M = 3.58 rating, M = 4.03 rating, respectively, on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 as
“excessively short” and 5 as “excessively long"; F(2,92) = 3.53, p = .03). However, the pilot study did not test
the effects of interactivity and multimedia separately, did not assess staff time, nor gather data on participants’
likelihood of enrolling in the clinical trial. The proposed study is needed to address these issues, determining
the effects of interactivity and multimedia separately assessing staff time needed to complete informed
consent, and measuring participants’ decisions about enrollment in an actual biorepository /R8].

Research Design.

Study Recruitment and Sample. [R5 The study will be integrated into the UIHC Biorepository’s
recruitment plan as currently being implemented in the Department of Dermatology and Division of
Immunology/Rheumatology at the UIHC (see letters from Murray, Fairley, Ballas, & Zabner). We anticipate
enrolling 220 participants (110 from Dermatology and 110 Immunology/Rheumatology respectively) over a 6-
month period, with 200 complete data and 10% (i.e., 20} additional participants to accommodate unforeseen
issues such as technology glitches, interruptions of participants, etc.

Procedures. Eligible participants will be approached regarding participation in the UIHC Biorepasitory.
Those who are interested in learning about the Biorepository will also be informed about this study. Under a
waiver of written consent, participants will receive a one-page description of the study, consent verbally to the
experiment, and be randomly assigned to one of the four consent conditions. Atter completing the consent
condition, participants will complete the Participant Questionnaire (see Appendix), and then be asked to decide
about participation in the Biorepository. Staff will have on-site access to the knowledge assessment results.
Participants who correctly answer all knowledge questions will be asked to confirm their decision to participate
in the Biorepository and be enrolled in it, if they agree. For participants who answer any questions incorrectly,
staff will review relevant information with them and determine that the participant understands her rights and
responsibilities before enrollment (see Recruitment Method diagram in Appendix}. Participants will receive 2
one-hour parking vouchers for participating. /R5]

Paper-based conditions. The paper-based low interactivity (PBLI) is the current IRB-approved informed
consent process (control). Staff review the informed consent document with the participant, allow him/her to
read the document, and respond to any participant questions. In the paper-based high interactivity (PBHI)
condition, the informed consent document will be divided into sections (i.e., nature of research, procedures,
risks, benefits, etc.). Staff will verbally review and allow the participant to read one section at a time; then staff
will ask at least one scripted question about a critical element of the section to assess participant knowledge.
Staff will provide feedback on the participant's response to the question, reinforcing correct answers and
clarifying misperceptions. Staff will be trained for consistency in their communication style and feedback.

(R2 Multimedia conditions. Limited data and research are available on interactive, multimedia delivery
system for the obtaining of biorepository consent. Therefore, we will develop and test the interactive module
templates (see Figure 1), widely used principles of instructional design and the expertise of PEI (see PEI
letter}, and on the experience of our Mayo and Marshfield consultants. CLT principles for effective multimedia
learning will be used to guide the design, including the chunking of text, selection of supporting graphics, and

used. The multimedia modules will use the IRB-approved eT —_ tne nda penis 0 eenan Ceamr

informed consent document as the text and narration. However,
the multimedia will be presented via a computer in the clinic
where participants are recruited for the Biorepository. In the
multimedia high interactivity (MMHI} condition, participants will
respond on the computer to the same questions at the same
points in the presentation as the paper-based high interactivity
(PBHI) condition. In both interactive conditions, participants will
receive feedback on their responses and will be allowed to
review the presented information for incorrect responses./R2]

Formative evaluation. Although the words for the )0 cr?
multimedia informed consent will not be modified because they Te
will be from the Biorepository’s IRB-approved consent
document, stakeholders and consultants will participate in a
formative evaluation of the multimedia presentation (graphics user controls (forward, back, replay, and sound
and animations) and the interactive components (questions and buttons) as well as buttons for responding to the
feedback) for the high interactivity conditions. Project question./R2]
consultants (Brilliant & McCormick), along with a University of
lowa genomics researcher and biorepository director (J. Murray}, an IRB Chair (A. Bertolatus), and a genetic
counselor and coordinator (J. L'Heureux) will participate in the evaluation (see corresponding letters of
support). Additionally, the UI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science community outreach program will
identify five community members to participate in the formative evaluation. Stakeholders will complete the
multimedia high interactivity module, respond to a heuristic evaluation form (Alessi & Trollip, 2001; see
Appendix) for the multimedia presentation, and participate in a verbal debriefing with study investigators. The
research team will use stakeholder feedback, where feasible and appropriate, to improve the presentation.
This tormative evaluation process will be reported in ensuing publications to contribute to the process literature
on multimedia consent development.

Outcome Measures. To test for knowledge and understanding, a four-part questionnaire (see
Appendix) has been developed. Participants in all conditions (PBLI, PBHI, MMLI & MMHI) will complete this
questionnaire post-experiment, on a computer in the clinic using an online survey format with recruiters out of
the room. Staff will be available to guide participants through the questionnaire and answer any questions. The
questionnaire is expected to take 20-30 minutes to complete. Questionnaire Sections A and B will measure
participants’ objective knowledge and subjective (self-assessed) understanding of the Biorepository consent
information. These measures are based on instruments developed and validated by Joffe et al. (2000) for
cancer research, and recently adapted by Ormond et al. (2009) for biorepository research. Section A measures
the participant's recall and recognition, while Section B assesses self-perceived level of understanding of this
knowledge. We have maintained the design, format, and testing domains of the original validated instruments.
Following Ormond et al., we have modified some content to reflect the unique characteristics of the UIHC
Biorepository {see Appendix, UIHC Biorepository Description and Consent Document). Section C measures
how well participants grasp the implications of biorepository participation based on what they have learned.
Whereas Sections A and B measure participants’ ability to recall basic information about the biorepository and
their perceived understanding, Section C measures how well participants are able to use that information, for a
more objective assessment of their level of understanding. Following the revised Bloom's Taxonomy of
Educational Objectives (Krathwohl, 2002), which provides a framework for assessing levels of understanding,
we developed a multiple choice instrument that measures the participants’ ability to interpret, classify, infer,
and compare learned information. This measure enriches the data from Sections A and B by objectively
assessing deeper understanding of the presented consent information. Section D collects demographic and
health data on participants and asks them to reflect on their experience in the experiment. These data will be
used to explore any possible variability in knowledge and understanding scores within and across conditions
and to gain participant perspectives on the experiment.

[R5, R7 Participants’ decision to participate/not participate in the UIHC Biorepository will be captured after
they have had an opportunity to ask questions/allay concerns about Biorepository participation, but before they
fill out the study questionnaire. Their decision will be confirmed after their knowledge/understanding of the
consent information has been assessed and remediated, if necessary (see Appendix, Decision to Participate in
Biobank Form, and Recruitment Method diagram). /R5, /R7]

[R9 Staff time devoted to informed consent has been previously used in empirical research as a key
efficiency variable (Beebe & Smith, 2010; Lavori et al., 1999}. The dependent variable, staff time, will be
measured as the total number of minutes that staff actively spend with the participant from the start of the
consent process (e.g., handing them the paper form or setting up the multimedia process) to the end point of
the consent process, and includes interactions and answering questions. Staff will be trained to record these
time segments reliably using standard digital timers (Migden et al., 2008). /R9]

Data Management and Analysis

Data Managemeni. The study’s working hypotheses will be tested using quantitative data from the
dependent measures. We will replicate Ormond et al.’s (2009) scoring procedures for the data from the
Knowledge and Understanding Measures. The 31 items in Part A will be individually scored (correct = 100,
unsure = 50, incorrect = 0), with scores summed and averaged. Part B consists of 21 5-point Likert scale
questions, which will be averaged and normalized to create an overall score from 0 to 100, with higher scores
reflecting higher perceived understanding. Part C will consist of 9 questions which will be scored as correct or
incorrect and summed to create an overall objective understanding score. Responses to Part D, the
demographic, health, and qualitative items, will be descriptively summarized. Data will be organized and
managed in SPSS, organized in linked databases to allow for comparison between the measures.

Data Analyses and Power. Data will be analyzed using a 2 x 2 factorial MANOVA using SPSS, with
format (paper-based and multimedia) and interactivity (low and high) as the independent variables and total
scores on the knowledge, self-assessed understanding, objective understanding instruments, and staff time as
the dependent variables. G*Power (Faul et al., 2007) Version 3.1.2 was used to calculate sensitivity of the
research design. Based on 200 total participants, 50 per group, at the 0.05 significance level, our design will be
able to detect an effect size of 0.7 SD (difference expressed in standard deviation units) with 0.80 power.
Qualitative feedback from participants will be managed using Nvivo software, and analyzed for recurring
themes within and across the experiment’s conditions.

Study Limitations, Timeline, and Expected Outcomes and Future Research

Limitations. Although participants will be recruited from different clinics, this feasibility study will not
have sufficient power to control for demographic and environmental (i.e., clinic) differences. Those analyses
are planned for the subsequent multi-site RO1. [R10 Additionally, low literacy, including scientific, health, and
genetic literacy, is a barrier for obtaining informed consent (Raich et al., 2001). While this study is unable to
explore literacy because of feasibility, our future work will aim to enhance the sensitivity of multimedia informed
consent for biorepositories to individual literacy, as well as educational and cultural background. Colleagues at
the Mayo Clinic, participating in our summative workshop, are ideally positioned to contribute in this respect
given their ongoing work in this area (e.g., Yost et al., 2010)./R10]

Timeline. The study will be completed within 24 months. The first 6 months of Year 1 will be devoted to
development and formative evaluation of informed consent processes. Data collection will begin in the second
6 months of Year 1 and be completed in the first 6 months of Year 2. Analysis, interpretation, and manuscript
preparation will be conducted during the remaining 6 months.

Expected Outcomes and Future Directions. This study determines the feasibility of using interactive
multimedia to improve knowledge/understanding of biorepository consent information, and the potential effects
of these improvements on the decision to enroll in DNA and tissue biorepositories. Results will allow the team
to pursue a multisite comparative study to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of interactive
multimedia consent across distinctive biorepository environments. [R3 Summative workshop - Our CTSA has
offered (see Rosenthal letter) to sponsor a ¥2 day workshop to strategize data dissemination and a future
research (R01) collaboration among the University of lowa, Marshfield Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and other
biorepository sites (e.g., NUGENE — see Smith letter) devoted to the application of multimedia to biorepository
informed consent. Planning for possible barriers to the transportability and adoption of multimedia innovations
will be a central focus of the workshop. Consultants McCormick, Brilliant, and one of their personnel (Catherine
Yost, Mayo; Wendy Foth, Marshfield), who have helped design multimedia consent systems and oversee their
day-to-day operations will participate in the workshop. The workshop will aim to produce an RO1 study outline
aiming to test in a multisite randomized trial a multimedia application that capitalizes on the R21 results, other
experimental systems, and the lessons learnt with multimedia in the lowa/Mayo/Marshfield consortium. /R3]

Potential Problems and Alternative Strategies Paper-based informed consent processes can vary
significantly from one recruiter to another (Schenker et al., 2011}. Since data will be collected in two clinics
using several recruiters, we will train recruiters and conduct follow-up monitoring and case-by-case data quality
control in an effort to reduce the potential for individual bias to affect the study.

6. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
6.1 Risks to Human Subjects

a. Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design
As part of recruitment for the University of lowa biorepository, participants will be asked to participate ina

one-session experiment comparing informed consent processes. All participants will need to meet the following
study criteria: 1) able to communicate in English, 2) age 18 or older, 3) non-prisoner status, 4) currently a
University of lowa Hospitals and Clinics patient, and 5) capable of providing informed consent for the study.

b. Sources of Materials:

Sources of material will include electronic copies of a participant questionnaire as well as electronic usage
data from the multimedia informed consent modules, which will be collected by computer servers. For this
study, all research materials will be de-identified. No names or other participant identifiers will be recorded on
electronic data. An idiosyncratic coding number will be used to ensure linkage of the participant questionnaire
and usage data, which will be separate and distinct from the participant's UIHC patient medical record number.
Data for the post-session assessment and questionnaire are collected using web-based forms over an
encrypted (https) connection. The computer server that holds subject assessment data is located in a
restricted-access room, with access only by the research team. Login access to the server is restricted to only
one member of the research team, the systems administrator and members of the College of Law IT
department. Once data collection is complete these data will be transferred to Excel or SPSS files, which will
be stored on a computer in the Pl's locked office. Computer security is consistent with the university's

electronic security policies as described here http://cio.uiowa.edu/policy/policy-information-security-
framework.shtml.

Names of participants will be collected only to ensure that someone is not accidentally reenrolled in the
study. The biorepository already has an IRB-approved process to ensure that potential participants are not
approached more than once.

c. Potential Risks

This study involves the collection of data from an experiment on informed consent involving the
administration of an electronic questionnaire and collection of usage data. It is believed that the probability and
magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those
ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations
or tests, meeting the criteria for minimal risk. Furthermore, the integration of this study as the informed consent
process for the biorepository does not increase the risks from the current biorepository informed consent
process. This study will be reviewed and all procedures as specified by The University of lowa IRB will be
followed.

6.2 Adequacy of Protection Against Risks

a. Recruitment and Informed Consent

All procedures as specified by The University of lowa IRB will be followed. Patients will be recruited and
enrolled into the study along with recruitment for the biorepository over a 12-month period from the
Dermatology and Immunclogy/Rheumatology clinics. Approximately 200 patients are expected to express
interest in this study.

Eligible participants will be approached regarding participation in the UIHC biorepository. Those who
express an interest in learning about the biorepository will also be informed about this study. Under a waiver of
written consent, participants will receive a one-page description of the study, consent verbally to the
experiment, and be randomly assigned to one of the four consent conditions. After completing the consent
condition, participants will 1} be asked whether/not they intend to participate in the biorepository; 2) complete
the Participant Questionnaire; 3) be given an opportunity to remediate any gaps in knowledge/understanding of
biorepository participation; and 4) be asked to confirm their decision as to participation in the Ul Biorepository
(see Appendix, Recruitment Method Diagram). Step 3 (i.e., opportunity to remediate gaps) will be undertaken
to help ensure that participants in all four study conditions complete the study and confirm their decision to
participate/not participate in the biorepository based on a uniformly robust knowledge/understanding of the
content of the officially approved UI Biorepository informed consent document (see Appendix). Step 3 will be

Protection of Human Subjects Page 51


==================================================
Page 26
==================================================

Principal Investigator’Program Director (Last, first, middle}: Simon, Christian, Michael

undertaken only with participants who do not score correctly on all knowledge/understanding questions in the
Participant Questionnaire. Recruiting staff will have immediate, on-site access to the knowledge/understanding
assessment results, in order to be able to assess if some informational element or elements of the consent
document need to be reviewed again. If the participant answers any questions incorrectly, staff will review
relevant information with the participant and determine that the participant understands her rights and
responsibilities before enrollment (see Recruitment Method diagram in Appendix). All participants will be asked
to confirm their decision to participate in the UI Biorepository and will be enrolled in the biorepository
dependent on their decision. All participants will be provided with two, one-hour parking vouchers for their time.

b. Protections Against Risk

There is a risk of loss of confidentiality of materials obtained for this study. In order to minimize this risk, all
study materials will be coded. No names or identifying information will be retained on any collected data
sources (questionnaire and usage information}. All research materials will be de-identified. No names or
identifiers will be recorded on electronic data. An idiosyncratic coding number will be used to ensure linkage of
the participant questionnaire and usage data, which will be separate and distinct from the participant's UIHC
patient medical record number. Data in electronic form will be stored on secure computers in the research
offices and will be accessible only to authorized research staff. Names of participants will be collected only to
ensure that someone is not accidentally reenrolled in the study. The biorepository already has an IRB-
approved process to ensure that potential participants are not approached more than once.

6.3 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others
Individual participants may not benefit from participating in the research.

6.4 Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained

Insights gained from this study may be useful to health policy makers, IRBs, and researchers who have a
stake in biorepository-driven research. Study data will advance understanding of the potential utility of
multimedia informed consent in biorepository recruitment procedures.

6.5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan

A true Data Safety Monitoring Board is not required, as the proposed study is not a clinical trial, but an
examination of informed consent in biorepository recruitment procedures. A plan is in place to insure the safe
handling of all data and the maintenance of confidentiality. This plan should be sufficient; however, the ultimate
responsibility for data safety rests with the Principal Investigators.

An important aspect of this research is instituting procedures to assure the safe management of all data
obtained from participants. In order to protect participants, the Institutional Review Board will review the study.
All appropriate guidelines will be followed, including the use of Informed Consent procedures. Data safety
procedures will be part of the annual review by the appropriate IRBs and any changes suggested by these
groups will be incorporated into the delineated data safety plan.

7. Inclusion of Women and Minorities

We will enroll male and female participants in the project, and we anticipate that the sample will be
approximately 50% female.

Approximately 5.6% of residents of lowa are members of minority groups and 4.0% are of Hispanic
origin. Based on our prior focus group and survey research on biobanking, we expect that at least 5%
of our sample will be English-speaking members of minority groups.

Dear Chris, Helen, David, and Jamie:

| am writing to give you my enthusiastic support for your proposed project on multi-media and
informed consent for biobanking. This project is a logical outgrowth of the current interest in
biobanking activities and concerns associated with the ethical procurement of bicbanked
tissue, DNA and access to electronic medical records.

Currently, | am the Director of the Genetics/Genomics Key Function for the NIH-CTSA grant
that is part of the University of lowa ICTS (institute for Clinica! Translational Science). At the
present time, we have begun sample coijlection for the University of lowa’s hospital-wide
biorepository linking discarded biologic specimens to electronic medical records. Participating
clinics include the Department of Dermatology and Division of Immunology.

| have worked closely with you and Jamie L'Heureux in developing the initial activities around
the biobank, including the informed consent protocol. We consulted many biobank experts in
developing this protocol, including at Vanderbilt University, Mayo Clinic, Marshfield Clinic, and
Northwestern University. Especially important, however, were the focus groups and state-wide
survey you and Jamie conducted, which showed decisively that there were strong preferences
in the state of lowa for a prospective opt-in consent process using a broad consent approach
for future research.

The use of multi-media has terrific potential to make the informed consent process for biobanks
more accessible and facilitative for affected patients, families, and consenting staff. One of the
early challenges that we have had in our neonatal bank, which has enrolled more than 4,000
individuals to date, is the promotion of an understandable and efficient consenting process.
Your proposal will make major steps toward addressing the best ways to carry this out. An
important strength of your proposal is the inclusion of a rigorously developed informed consent
document in your randomized experiment to compare use of the multi-media and standard
consent processes.

You and Jamie have played an excellent leadership role in developing an evidence-based

consent protocol for the hospital-wide bicbank, anc in partnering with Helen Schartz and David
Klein and their deep background in the use of multi-media. | look forward to the important

15. Resource Sharing Plan

This project will yield quantitative and some qualitative data generated by a post-
experiment questionnaire. Aggregated data from the questionnaire and findings resulting
from the analysis of these data will be shared through publications and conference
proceedings resulting from this project. A summative workshop will be held at the end of
Year 2 of the grant to identify potential barriers to adoption of the multimedia consent
tool, strategize data dissemination, and plan for a future research {RO1) collaboration
among researchers from the University of lowa, Marshfield Clinic, Mayo Clinic and
potentially other institutions experimenting with or interested in the application of
multimedia to biorepository consent processes. The workshop will produce an RO1 study
outline for a collaborative multi-site, multi-environment randomized experiment of a
composite multimedia consent tool.
