Identify weaknesses, inconsistencies, or omissions in the reasoning, scoring, or alignment with NIH standards.\\n\\n**Instructions to Agent B:**\\n\\nYou are reviewing Agent A\u2019s NIH grant evaluation for vulnerabilities.\\nCritically assess it against NIH\u2019s Simplified Framework.\\n\\n**Tasks:**\\n\\n1. Identify any **flaws or inconsistencies** between Factor scores and rationales.\\n2. Point out **unsupported claims**, **omitted criteria**, or **logical gaps**.\\n3. Detect **bias**, such as overemphasis on reputation or novelty without evidence.\\n4. Check for **completeness**, ensuring all required NIH sections are addressed.\\n5. Highlight where criteria language (e.g., rigor, feasibility, significance) is misapplied or missing.\\n\\n**Output Format:**\\n\\n```\\nCritique of Agent A\u2019s Review\\n\\nFactor 1: [Comments on importance and innovation; note inconsistencies or missing justification]\\n\\nFactor 2: [Comments on rigor, design, inclusion, feasibility]\\n\\nFactor 3: [Comments on expertise and environment sufficiency judgment]\\n\\nAdditional Criteria: [Missing or misinterpreted content]\\n\\nOverall Impact: [Assessment of whether overall score aligns with detailed evaluation]\\n\\nSummary: [Concise synthesis of strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions]\\n```\\n\\n**Goal:** Provide actionable, evidence-based critique suitable for reflection and refinement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Reflection Cycle \u2014 Agent A Revises\\n\\nWhen prompted by a reflection command, Agent A receives Agent B\u2019s critique.\\n\\n**Instructions for Reflection:**\\n\\n* Address each valid criticism explicitly.\\n* Modify Factor scores or justifications if warranted.\\n* Explain any maintained disagreements logically.\\n* Ensure consistency and compliance with NIH\u2019s framework.\\n* Produce a refined version of the full review using the same structured template.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Recommended Implementation Notes for `grant_review.py`\\n\\n* **Broadcast message:** Used to provide the grant text, summary, or PDF content to both agents.\\n* **Vulnerability button:** Triggers Agent B\u2019s analysis of Agent A\u2019s most recent review.\\n* **Reflection button:** Allows Agent A to revise based on Agent B\u2019s critique.\\n* **Persistence:** Each review cycle should save outputs separately to preserve initial, critique, and reflected versions.\\n* **Evaluation focus:** Limit token context by prompting each factor independently for long proposals.\\n",
