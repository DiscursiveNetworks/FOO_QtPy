This debate usually references highly predictive and serious genetic diseases, such \nas Huntington's Disease or Lynch Syndrome. In reality, most variants have a wide range of predictive values, \nfrom unknown to low to high. There has been little debate about how predictive a variant must be for \nsupplemental insurers to use-or to be legally allowed to use-the information . Additionally , for some highly \npredictive variants, medical interventions may be available to minimize one's indicated risk, and the law does \nnot currently shed light on how insurers should consider this information . State unfair trade practice laws \ngenerally require insurers to have actuarial justification for using any risk factor in underwriting . Under these \nactuarial laws, to deny an application or charge an increased premium, insurers must show that a relevant risk \nfactor is statistically associated with increased insurer cost. However, in the US, there has been little research \nregarding the application of these standards to genetic and genomic data. Internationally , several countries, \nsuch as the UK and Australia, have had actuarial policies for supplemental insurers specific to genetic testing \nsince the early 2000s. Thus, most of the academic and policy discussions in this area have occurred abroad. \nAlthough the Genetic Information Nondiscriminat ion Act (GINA) protects against genetic discrimination in \nemployment and health insurance , individuals may fail to undertake medically recommended clinical genetic \ntesting, or participate in genomic research, due to fears of discrimination in supplementa l insurance. Policy \nresponses tend to focus on whether supplemental insurers should be able to use genetic information , but do \nnot explore the broader criteria that inform when and how such information can legally be used. Once studied, \nthese criteria can inform a more nuanced policy discussion of the 'should'. This project has two primary goals: \n1) to systematically examine the legal and policy landscape of supplemental insurer use of genetic information \nin the US and internationally, with particular focus on requirements of actuarial justification; and 2) to use these \nrequirements to offer a variety of policy options for US state and federal governments that seek to address \ngenetic discrimination in supplemental insurance. To meet these goals, I propose three specific aims. \nAim 1 -Analyze how international approaches to actuarial justification , supplemental insurance , and genetic \ninformation may be applicable to the US. Using methods and analysis techniques acquired during the \nmentored-phase, I will choose four countries that have robust policies regarding actuarial justification and \ninsurer use of genetic information and conduct case studies of these examples . Focus on actuarial standards \nin the international privatized supplemental insurance sector ensures a more direct comparison with the US, \ndespite differences across health insurance sectors. I will explore why specific policy options were chosen, \nwhether these policies address issues related to predictive value or preventive measures , how effective the \npolicies have been, and what lessons were learned. Case study analysis will combine both policy analysis and \ntargeted interviews with key stakeholders such as academic/policy experts, government officials, advocacy \ngroup representat ives, and insurance representatives . \nAim 2 -Interrogate how existing US state laws that require actuarial justification in supplemental insurance \nwould apply to use of genetic information . Using multiple methods, I will explore how current state law may \napply to genetic information. I will conduct a survey of US state insurance commissioners to examine how they \nare interpreting and enforcing actuarial and unfair trade practice laws (Aim 2a). I will combine this with legal \nanalysis of statutes, regulations , and applicable case law to evaluate whether state law has been applied to the \ncontext of genetic information and how the laws may be interpreted and enforced in this area (Aim 2b ). Survey \nresponses will inform the legal analysis of how existing legislation may be enforced or interpreted . \nAim 3 -Provide policy analysis and recommendations for legislative and regulatory options to address \nconcerns about the use of genetic information in supplemental insurance. I will undertake policy analysis of \noptions available to US governments to address societal and individual concerns about supplemental insurer \nuse of genetic information (Aim 3a). Additional policy analysis will explore legal and policy options for the \nthreshold evidence levels needed to meet actuarial standards (Aim 3b ). These options will incorporate \nfeedback from policy experts. I will dissemina te recommendations through policy briefs and manuscripts. \nAims 1 and 2a (K99 phase) will be completed in concert with training in qualitative and quantitative methods. \nFor the R00 phase, my goal is to secure a tenured law position that involves teaching an experiential course \nand researching ELSI topics. Under this model, students will assist in the research goals of Aims 2b and 3. \nBy combining policy analysis and case studies from the international setting with detailed legal and survey \nanalysis from the US, this project will produce a robust study of potential policy options for legislators. \nSpecific Aims Page 87 \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nResearch Strategy \nSignificance \nImagine an individual who is known to have a genetic variant that was reported in a genome-wide association \nstudy (GWAS) to be weakly correlated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, a leading cause of \ndeath worldwide. Should life, long-term care, or disability insurance companies be able to use this information \nin underwriting decisions, even if the genetic variant only explains about 1-2% of variation in risk? What if the \nvariant explains 10% of risk? Or 80%? What if it explains 80% of risk, but there are measures that an individual \ncan take to eliminate or mitigate this risk? \nThere has been a long-standing debate in the US regarding whether life, long-term care, or disability insurers, \nshould be able to use genetic information in underwriting (Caulfield 2013, Joly 2013, Klitzman 2014, Ostrer \n1993, Rothstein 1997). I refer to these insurers as supplemental insurers, in that they are purchased in addition \nto health insurance. I do not refer to health policies, such as a Medicare supplemental policy, that an individual \nacquires in addition to his or her existing health insurance. The supplemental insurer debates have often \nremained entrenched in discussion about whether or not insurers should be able to use genetic information \n(Mittra 2007). There has been little research and policy discussion of, if supplemental insurers have access to \ngenetic information, when and how they should be able to use it in underwriting . This research project \nexamines how law and policy address, or should address, the threshold of statistical significance between \ngenetic information and increased risk necessary for insurers to charge higher premium rates or deny a policy. \nIn 2008, in response to the public's concerns of genetic discrimination, Congress passed the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). GINA prevents employers and health insurers from using genetic \ninformation to discriminate , but does not regulate how supplemental insurers use genetic information (McGuire \n2009). These insurers were not included in GINA due to political compromise and recognition that the \neconomic models and social goals of supplemental insurance raise different policy considerations than health \ninsurance (Hudson 2008). However, in the years since GINA's passage, individuals remain fearful of genetic \ndiscrimination in supplementa l insurance (Allain 2012, Laedtke 2012, Parkman 2014). This fear may lead \nindividuals not to undergo recommended clinical genetic testing or to decline participat ion in genomic research \n(Barlow-Stewart 2009, Feldman 2012, Joly 2010, Klitzman 2010, Peshkin 2013), potentially leading to \ndetrimental health effects for those who do not undertake clinically beneficial testing (Otlowski 2012). Failure to \nundergo predictive testing for a medically actionable condition due to fear of discriminatory consequences \ncould thwart an individual from preventing or mitigating disease. \nSince federal law does not address supplemental insurer use of genetic information, any US-based policy in \nthis area currently comes from state law. Several states address insurer use of genetic information (NCSL \n2008). Three states are commonly cited as banning supplemental insurer use of genetic information (Peikoff \n2014 ); in fact, these states do not completely prohibit insurer use, but rather, they prohibit use of family \nmembers' genetic information (O.R.S 2001, V.S.A. 1997) or have actuarial requirements for the use (Cal-GINA \n2011, Chabner 2000). Requiring actuarial justification for use of genetic information in underwriting decisions , \nsuch as premium increases or denials, is a common legislative strategy. These laws generally require that \ninsurers demonstrate statistical correlation between a risk and an increased likelihood of cost to the insurer \n(ASOP 2005, Jha 2012, Landes 2014). The interpretation, enforcement, and implementation of these actuarial \nlaws, however, have not been fully analyzed. It is therefore surprisingly unclear how existing state laws have \nbeen or will be applied in the context of the predictive value and preventive measures of genetic variants. \nRecent technological advances have drastically lowered the cost of sequencing , making genomic analysis \npotentially affordable for insurers. This information may be beneficial to insurers since underwriting involves \ncategoriz ing applicants into risk classifications and genetic information can provide insight into future risk (Van \nHoyweghen 2007). However, the use of genetic information also raises social concerns beyond the business \nconsiderations of insurers (Dubois 2011, Liukko 2010, Morris 2010, Moultrie 1997, Van Hoyweghen 2005, Van \nHoyweghen 2012). For example, some, including myself, have argued or suggested that in order to fully \naddress individual fears of genetic discrimination, supplementa l insurers should be restricted from using \ngenetic information (Ashcroft 2007, Gruber 2014, Klitzman 2014, Prince 2013, Wolf 2007). Others have argued \nthat this would bankrupt the insurance system because it will skew risk classification and lead to adverse \nselection (Baker 2002, Dodge 2007, Green 2015, Joly 2010, Radetzki 2003, Rothstein 2004); yet there is little \nResearch Strategy Page 88 \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nempirical evidence of any effects of adverse selection following policy changes (Daykin 2003) and actuarial \nmodeling has indicated low impacts on premiums (Macdonald 2011; 201 0; 2003, Viswanathan 2007). The \ncompeting economic concerns of insurers and the privacy and justice concerns of individuals create polarizing \ninterests and lead to an entrenched debate over insurers' use of genetic information (Joly 2010). \nThis proposed project is significant because it will provide policy-makers with in-depth analysis of policy and \nregulatory options and recommendations for how life, long-term care, and disability insurers use genetic \ninformation. The NHGRI has specifically identified use of genetic information by these supplemental insurance \ncompanies, determination of actuarial risk, and the impact of state laws as priorities for ELSI legal, regulatory, \nand public policy research (NHGRI 2014 ). Genomic technolog ies will not rise to their full clinical potential if fear \nof discriminat ion or misunderstanding of existing legal protections prevents individuals from undertaking \ngenomic testing or participating in research. This project highlights lessons from international contexts; \nanalyzes existing state legislation; and provides policy recommendations for future legislatures. Existing state \nlaws offer an opportunity to suggest policy changes through a variety of mechanisms , from enforcement \nstrategies to regulatory changes to new legislation. Providing meaningfu l and feasible policy options and a \nbetter understanding of how insurers can legally use genetic information can make several contributions : \nassuage fears of genetic discrimination , increase participation in genomic testing and research, and potentially \nprevent significant barriers in access to supplemental insurance . In turn, increased insurance coverage and \nutilization of genomic technologies can lead to greater economic stability and improved health for individuals. \nInnovation \nThis proposal is original in its approach to the question of whether supplemental insurers should be able to use \ngenetic information. By beginning the inquiry with how insurers can fairly or legally use such information , rather \nthan if they should use it at all, this project can provide new insight to an entrenched US debate. Focusing on \nhow international actuarial standards have been applied to genetic and genomic risk information allows this \nproject to draw lessons from countries with distinct socio-historical contexts. Additionally, the proposed \nresearch project is innovative in the way that it combines legal and policy analysis with social science empirical \nanalysis in a law school setting. Use of an experiential course model increases the amount of research that \ncan be undertaken with the same amount of funding because students will provide research assistance as part \nof their experiential learning. Through this novel approach, I can simultaneously increase my chances of \nsecuring a position as an independent researcher, increase the impact of the project given the increased \nresearch that can be completed, and establish a mechanism to train future ELSI legal scholars. The proposal is \nalso novel in its recognition of the importance of mentorsh ip in the R00 phase and the inclusion of a specific \nprofessional development component on mentorship within the training plan. \nApproach \nAim 1: Analyze how international approaches to actuarial justification , supplemental insurance , and genetic \ninformation may be applicable to the US. \nAim 1 Rationale: Several countries have long established policies that impose actuarial justification standards \nor regulate supplemental insurers in the context of genetic information . Because these countries often have \nuniversal health care systems that limit concerns of discrimination and access in the health care setting, policy \ndiscussions regarding concerns about genetic discrimination have focused on the supplemental insurances \nthat are often privatized (Anderlik 2001, Knoppers 2004b). Compared to the US, these countries are generally \nmore advanced in policy implementation in the context of supplemental insurance (Van Hoyweghen 2007). \nThere are three primary avenues that countries have used to address supplemental insurer use of genetic \ninformation (Knoppers 2004a, Lemmens 2003), although within these broad strategies there are a variety of \ntypes of policies (Joly 2010, Lemke 2013, Otlowski 2012, Quinn 2014, Varga 2012). First, insurers in some \ncountries have voluntarily agreed to a moratorium on the use of genetic information for applications below a \ncertain monetary value and to a requirement of actuarial justification for those above that value (Huijgen 2012, \nSoini 2012). For example, since 2001, supplemental insurers in the United Kingdom have had a voluntary \nmoratorium , which was just recently extended to 2019 (HMG 2011, Thomas 2012). Second, some countries \nhave passed legislation at the federal level requiring actuarial justification in this area (Soini 2012, Van \nHoyweghen 2012). Utilizing this strategy, Australia has legislation that requires certain supplemental insurers \nto have actuarial justification for using genetic information (ALRC 2003, Keogh 2013, Taylor 2004 ). Third, \nResearch Strategy Page 89 \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nsome countries have informal guidelines from a government advisory or regulatory body (Knoppers 2004a, \nLemmens 2004). In these countries the guidance may not be legally binding on the insurers. \nExploration of the effectiveness of these approaches in the international context can provide lessons for policy \nimplementation in the US. Although US states do have actuarial laws, there has not been robust policy \ndiscussion regarding how these laws may be enforced. As such, examining the international context first, \nwhere there have been debates, can inform the nuanced legal analysis of Aim 2. Although the health insurance \nsystems across international contexts vary, the privatized supplemental insurance context provides a more \ndirectly comparable perspective to the US (Rothstein & Joly 2009). Specific focus on the standards of actuarial \njustification and the threshold levels of evidence needed to use genetic information in supplemental insurance \nunderwriting also allows for an opportunity to gather lessons from international countries that have already \nbeen grappling with these nuances for many years, but without insurmountab le concerns of applicability from \ndiffering socio-historical contexts. Through qualitative case studies of internationa l experiences , Aim 1 will \nprovide valuable information for the US-based policy analysis of Aims 2 and 3 of this project. Case study \nmethods offer not only in-depth analysis of the individual cases but also analytic strategies for systematically \ncomparing patterns observed across cases (Ragin 1999, Ragin 2014, Stake 2013, Yin 2003). \nAim 1 Methods: Aim 1 will utilize a qualitative , comparative case study analysis to explore how actuarial \njustification laws and policies in four countries have been applied to the use of genetic information in \nunderwriting. Data sources include semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and analysis of policy \ndocuments, such as government reports or legislation, legislative history, internal government or insurance \ncommunications , legal case documents, and academic critiques or manuscripts regarding the policies. Each \ncase study will utilize these multiple sources of data to allow for triangulation (Stake 2013, Yin 2003). \nInitially I plan to conduct a pilot case study in Canada in order to test my interview protocol, determine the most \nefficient and effective ways to recruit stakeholders and collect data, and to confirm the feasibility of my case \nstudy methods. Canada is a fitting pilot study due to the proximity to the US, the robust discussions regarding \nactuarial justification policies that have occurred in the country to date (Joly 2006, Joly 2014, Lemmens 2010, \nPullman 2010), and the support of a key stakeholder to assist with the identification and recruitment of other \nstakeholders (See Joly Support Letter). Canada has published guidance on use of genetic information in life \ninsurance (Knoppers 2004b) and the legislature is currently considering a bill to ban insurer use of genetic \ninformation (Rennie 2013). Additionally, at the beginning of the project, I will undertake a screening process to \nselect the remaining three purposively sampled cases (Yin 2003). These countries will be chosen to include \nrepresentation of the three primary policy tactics (moratorium, legislation, or guidelines) utilized around the \nworld. Cases will be selected that have had at least one policy mechanism in place for five years or more, have \nstakeholders with English language skills, and have similarities to the US for comparison. \nI will explore the following research questions for each case study: \n• Why was the particular policy option chosen in this country? \n• How effective has the policy been, as judged by the stakeholders? \n• How has the actuarial justification policy been applied to genetic information , specifically regarding the \npredictive value of genetic variants and the availability of preventive measures? \n• Have there been any consequences, unexpected or expected , of the policy, and if so, what are they? \n• From the stakeholders ' perspectives, has the policy affected how often either individuals undertake \ngenetic or genomic testing or apply for supplemental insurance? \nDocument Collection: Initially, I will collect policy documents and analysis available online through government \nwebsites and searches of academic databases such as LexisNexis, JSTOR, and PubMed. The CGS summer \nlegal research assistant will assist with this task. However, since the availability of international documents \nmay be limited in the US, I will also establish meetings with government and research librarians in the case \nstudy countries to gather additional relevant documents unavailable in the US. During each interview, I will also \nask the respondents for suggestions of documents the respondent thinks might be informative to the study. \nInterviews : Employing the skills I will acquire through focused trainings on qualitative interview design, I will \ncreate and conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (King 2010). For each case study I will \ninterview at least 8 stakeholders representing policy experts, government officials, advocacy group members , \nand insurance representatives. To the extent possible in each country I will speak to at least two stakeholders \nResearch Strategy Page 90 \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nfrom each category. This targeted interviewing of a diverse group of stakeholders is important for minimizing \nsingle-source information bias, maximizing the range of perspectives , and collecting differential knowledge \n(Van de Ven 1999). These stakeholders will be identified through help from my international contacts (See De \nPaor, Joly, and Macdonald Letters), policy documents and research, and suggestions from individuals who \nhave agreed to be interviewed . Although this approach has the potential to create a participant population \nskewed to one perspective, this will not be likely since the nature of policy discussions inevitably highlight \ndiverse opinions. Therefore, already identified policy-makers and key stakeholders are likely to know, and will \nbe asked to identify, individuals with a broad range of perspectives and opinions. They will be enrolled through \na recruitment letter and follow-up phone call. I will pilot test my data collection protocol and semi-structured \ninterview guide in Canada, and then conduct the three additional case studies. Interviews will be conducted in \nperson to ensure convenience for the participants, quality of the interview, minimization of technological \ncomplications, and ease of document collection pre and post-interview (See Foreign Justification). \nData Analysis: I will undertake content analysis of the interview transcripts utilizing software, such as ATLAS.ti, \nthat aids in this kind of analysis. I will be trained in content analysis through classes at the Odum Institute, \nAALS Qualitative Workshop, and Research Talk. I will also pursue my analysis by comparing the content of the \npolicy documents collected with the themes extracted from the interviews. \nAim 1 Expected and Alternative Outcomes: For each country studied I will develop a written overview that \nincludes: 1) a descriptive summary of the policy method(s) implemen ted and the context in which it was \nimplemented , 2) a description of how actuarial justification standards have been applied to genetic information , \n3) an overview of how effective the policy has been according to documents and interview respondents, and 4) \nan assessment of the benefits and challenges of each policy. After individual case analysis, I will perform a \ncross-case analysis, examining whether the application of actuarial justification standards differs across policy \noptions. To disseminate these research findings I will publish at least one manuscript summarizing the case \nstudy research findings. Additionally, I will present my findings at national conferences such as the American \nSociety for Bioethics and Humanities (ASBH) and the Law and Society Association (LSA). \nInternational policy analysis and recruitmen t for interviews can be challenging; however, I believe that I will be \nable to recruit adequate numbers of interview participants. There is robust scholarship regarding actuarial \njustification policies and genetic information in the international setting, making it likely that I can find willing \nand interested participants to discuss the implications of these policies. Additionally , through my previous work \nand through support of my advisory committee members , Ors. De Paor and Macdonald , I have connections to \nthe European genetics communities , and through my collaborator Dr. Joly, the Canadian community (See \nSupport Letters). Thus, I will be able to reach out to a variety of contacts for suggestions of key stakeholders . \nBy undertaking a pilot feasibility case study and by waiting to choose the remaining three case study countries \nuntil the project is underway, I can foresee and avoid problems related to recruitment of stakeholders or \nconducting the case studies. If I am unable to gather sufficient research participant interest in a country, I will \nchoose a different option for the case study. Additionally , if the Canadian pilot study highlights problems with \nthe initial case study design I can rework the protocol with support from mentors for the remaining cases. \nAim 2 -Interrogate how existing US state laws that require actuarial justification in supplemental insurance \nwould apply to use of genetic information \nAim 2 Rationale: Under state unfair trade practice laws, life insurers in all fifty states are required to have \nactuarial justification to use a risk factor in underwriting (Holmes 1996, McEwen 1993, UTPA 2004 ). Some \nstates have expanded these rules to disability and long-term care insurers (Avraham 2014). In addition, eight \nstates explicitly require actuarial justification for the use of genetic information in underwriting (NCSL 2008). \nThese laws aim to restrict supplemental insurers from basing underwrit ing decisions on genetic information \nthat is unrelated to risk. However, the genetic-specific actuarial justification laws likely do not provide any \nadditional protections for individuals beyond the broader unfair trade practice laws (Rothstein 2007). \nThese state laws, both the genetic-specific and general unfair trade practice laws, have not been fully explored \nand further research is needed to understand how these rules will be applied in the context of genetic variants. \nGiven the range of predictive value of genetic variants, it is uncertain how many will be sufficiently correlated to \nrisk to meet actuarial standards (Evans 2001, Janssens 2006, Macdonald 2002) and how the preventive \nmeasures available to mitigate risk will and should fit into the legal actuarial standards (Keogh 2013). Although \nResearch Strategy Page 91 \n\n--- Page 6 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \ninsight into these questions will come from the international data obtained in Aim 1, it is also important to \nunderstand how the US state laws are being applied, and most significantly, could be applied, in this context. \nInsurance companies, including life, long-term care, and disability insurers, are regulated through state \ninsurance commissioners and in every state the insurance commissioner has the power to enforce state \ninsurance laws and promulgate regulation (Randall 2008). The commissioner offices also provide services to \nconsumers of these insurances through information and complaint systems (NAIC 2011 ). Through their work \nwith both insurers and consumers, the insurance commissioners are an essential source of information for how \nactuarial justification laws are being used. Through surveys of state insurance commissioners, and legal \nanalysis of state law, regulation , and court cases, Aim 2 will provide an opportunity to better understand how \nactuarial justification and unfair trade practice laws are currently being enforced and implemented in the US. \nAim 2 Methods: Aim 2 will employ multiple methods to analyze US actuarial justification laws and will involve \ntwo sub-aims: Aim 2a will survey state insurance commissioners to determine how they are enforcing and \ninterpreting actuarial justification laws; based on survey results, Aim 2b will undertake a legal analysis of \ncurrent state actuarial justification and unfair trade practice laws. There are already a handful of cursory state \nlaw reviews that will inform the survey (CLRC 2012, CRG 2014, NCSL 2008). I am proposing to undertake the \nin-depth legal analysis after the surveys in order to conduct a more nuanced and detailed legal analysis. \nSurvey: For Aim 2a, I will develop and implement a survey of state insurance commissioners about actuarial \nand unfair trade practice laws and how the commissioners interpret and enforce these laws. The survey will \nfocus on genetic information, the low predictive value of most variants, and the preventive measures available \nfor some genetic variants. Surveys and interviews of insurance commissioners have been used in prior studies \nto understand how health and life insurers could use genetic information, including a case study analysis \ncompleted by my co-mentor Prof. Hall (Hall 2000a, Hall 2000b, Hall 2000c, McEwen 1992). Aim 2a survey \nquestions will be developed in concert with feedback from mentors and based on survey methodology trainings \nundertaken through the Odum Institute. In addition to questions on how current state laws are interpreted and \nenforced, the survey will include questions that draw upon policy themes discovered during Aim 1. It will \ninclude both closed and open-ended questions surrounding these themes. The surveys will be sent to all state \ncommissioners and follow-up letters and phone calls will be made to reach state offices that have not \nresponded . In a prior study surveying state commissioners, this method was found to lead to a remarkably high \nresponse rate (82.4%) (McEwen 1992). The CGS legal research assistant will assist with survey analysis and \nfollow-up on any laws cited by the commissioners. To disseminate the survey results, I will publish findings in \npeer-reviewed journals, and use the information about enforcement and interpretation to assist with the legal \nanalysis of Aim 2b. Additionally, I will present my work at national conferences such as ASBH and LSA. \nLegal Analysis: For Aim 2b, I will conduct a fifty state review of laws, regulations, and court case decisions \n(case law) relating to actuarial justification , both genetic-specific and broader unfair trade practice laws. I will \nspecifically explore whether and how actuarial standards are defined and whether genetic-specific actuarial \njustification laws provide, or potentially provide, protections beyond those the state unfair trade practice laws. If \nthe plain text of the statute or regulation is unclear, I will employ statutory interpretation methodology I learned \nwhen I took the \"Lawmaking and Statutory Interpretation Seminar\" taught by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes­\nNorton. This state review will provide a comprehensive guide to which state laws apply to which supplemental \ninsurers. Several organizations have completed state guides regarding state laws covering genetic information \nin supplemental insurance (CLRC 2012, CRG 2014, NCSL 2008) and other sources have information on state \nunfair trade practice laws (Avraham 2014, Holmes 1996); however no study has combined information about \nhow all these laws may work in practice, with specific focus on whether and how actuarial standards are \ndefined. These previous guides will form my starting data points, so my initial data collection will involve \nupdating available cites, rather than a new search. In addition to this background analysis of state laws and \nregulations, Aim 2b will use legal analysis to examine applicable case law to evaluate whether state law has \nbeen used in the context of genetic information and how the laws may be interpreted and enforced in this area. \nBoth the state statutes and the case law will be compiled through searches of WestlawNext , a legal database. \nThe specific questions of inquiry in the case law analysis will include: \n• Is there any case law explicitly addressing genetic information and actuarial justification or unfair trade \npractice laws? \nResearch Strategy Page 92 \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \n• Does past case law define or discuss actuarial standards or address what level of statistical correlation is \nnecessary for insurers to use risk factor information in underwriting? \n• How might precedential case law regarding medical information or disability be applied in the context of \ngenetic information? \n• Is there any case law that discusses how supplemental insurers should take into account mitigating risk \nfactors, such as available preventive measures? \nAim 2 Expected and Alternative Outcomes: Aim 2a will culminate in at least one published manuscript \nsummarizing the state insurance commissioner survey design, methodology, and results. To disseminate the \ninformation from Aim 2b I will complete a published law review article describing the findings of the statute, \nregulation, and case law analysis. I am expecting to find that the genetic-specific actuarial justification laws do \nnot provide any additional legal protections beyond state unfair trade practice laws. Additionally, I am expecting \nthat few cases will explicitly address genetic information in this arena. However, because the genetic-specific \nand unfair trade practice laws are likely similar, case law regarding how unfair trade practice laws have applied \nto other medical information provides important legal precedent for how future courts will apply these laws to \nthe context of genetic information. \nAnalysis of statutes in fifty states can be time consuming to complete and, depending upon the volume of \napplicable or precedential case law, the case analysis can also be time consuming. However, these tasks of \nAim 2b will be completed during the R00 phase of the project. During this phase, my goal is to have students \nassist with the data collection and analysis as part of their experiential class. This model will allow for sufficient \nresearch support to complete the full fifty state analysis. If, however, I am unable to secure this teaching \nopportunity and/or do not have sufficient research support to analyze the case law and statutes from all states, \nI plan to limit the number of states that I examine to a representative sample. \nAim 3 -Provide policy analysis and recommendat ions for legislative and regulatory options to address \nconcerns about the use of genetic information in supplemental insurance . \nAim 3 Rationale: Since the passage of GINA, there has been discussion of whether the federal government \nshould pass additional legislation that expands protection against genetic discrimination in supplemental \ninsurances. There are strong competing interests on both sides of this debate: Individuals fear the misuse of \ntheir genetic information and supplemental insurers fear the economic consequences and adverse selection in \ntheir businesses (Daykin 2003, Haidle 2014, Macdona ld 2002, Rothstein & Joly 2009). These competing views \ncreate difficult policy decisions for state and federal legislators. However, international and US state \nexperiences to date can provide valuable insight into the feasibility , implications, and benefits of various policy \noptions. Aim 3 of this project will synthesize information and data collected through Aims 1 and 2 to create \npolicy analyses and reports of various options, including the moratorium , legislative, and guideline options from \nthe international context. Aims 1 and 2 will help to better understand the varying interpretations of the levels of \nevidence needed to meet actuarial justification and unfair trade practice laws. From there, Aim 3 can provide \npolicy guidance to state insurance commissioners , state legislators , individuals , insurance companies , and \nadvocates about enforcement, interpretations, and legal uses of genetic information in underwriting . \nAim 3 Methods: Using policy analysis skills I developed during my graduate training in my Masters of Public \nPolicy, Aim 3 will include two levels of policy analysis and inquiry. First, Aim 3a will be a policy analysis of the \nlegislative options available at the federal and state level to address supplemental insurer use of genetic \ninformation, ranging from status quo to a complete ban on use, and other options in between. The analysis will \ninclude an assessment of the potential limitations, benefits, and feasibility of various policy options. \nThe policy analysis will explore the following questions : \n• Do current state policies effectively address supplemental insurer use of genetic information? \n• Is additional , or different, enforcement of current state laws needed to afford effective protection? \n• Would any of the policy mechanisms implemented in the international context be options for US federal or \nstate governments? \n• What are the limitations, benefits, and feasibility of various policy options? \nSecond, Aim 3b will assess how both international case studies and the states define evidence thresholds for \nthe necessary level of statistical correlation to use genetic information in underwriting. I will conduct policy \nResearch Strategy Page 93 \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nanalysis of these varying interpretations and actuarial definitions to assess the implications of various evidence \nthresholds. If there have not been clear evidence thresholds or if the thresholds are consistent, I will assess the \nimplications of what the threshold could or should be. This will provide policy makers, insurance companies, \ninsurance commissioners , and individuals undergoing genetic testing guidance on when and how genetic \ninformation can and should legally be used for underwriting. In order to receive feedback and suggestions on \nvarious policy options, I will vet options with US policy experts, such as Dr. Koontz, my advisory committee \nmember, to discuss issues of actuarial justification , genetic information, and supplemental insurance. \nAs with Aim 2b, the research of Aim 3 will be completed within the RO0 portion of the grant; therefore my goal \nis to complete this research within the context of the experiential class at a law school. The assistance of \nstudents in the legal and policy analysis creates the ability to increase the output of policy analysis to potential \nstate-specific white papers or other in-depth policy analysis given findings from the previous Aim(s). \nAim 3 Expected and Alternative Outcomes: Aim 3 will culminate in a series of policy briefs, or white papers, \nthat legislators at the federal and state levels can utilize. These briefs will be disseminated to the state \ninsurance commissioners who participated in Aim 2 in order to have maximum impact. Discussions and \nfeedback from policy experts will also be incorporated into the policy reports as well as compiled into a \nmanuscript summarizing the key recommendat ions of the group. I will write at least one law review or peer­\nreviewed journal article summariz ing the policy findings of the project in order to disseminate the information to \na wider audience . I will also attend conferences , such as ASBH and LSA, to present my work. \nAlthough Aim 3 will draw largely on the information gathered during Aims 1 and 2, the research and analysis of \nAim 3 is not dependent upon a certain outcome in the previous aims. Even in the unlikely event that there is \nlittle information gathered on the interpretation of actuarial and unfair trade practice laws, this absence of \nguidance still provides a critical opportunity to explore possible options for the future. \nSince the policy analysis of Aim 3 will occur in Years 4 and 5, it is possible that new state or federal legislation \nmay be passed before the final years of the grant. I will track any changes in policy throughout the grant \nperiod. If changes occur, the skills gained during the K99 training will allow me to alter the policy analysis as \nneeded. For example, if federal legislation addressing supplemental insurer use of genetic information is \npassed during the grant, I can conduct a case study of the new legislation to assess enforcement options, \nissues that can be addressed by ensuing regulation , and the potential effectiveness of the law. \nThrough detailed policy and case study analysis from the international setting and robust legal and survey \nanalysis from the US, my proposed K99/R00 will recommend potential policy options for supplemental insurer \nuse of genetic information , thus supporting and informing an important NHGRI ELSI research priority. \nR00 lndeoendent Phase Research Year3 \nAim 2b: Legal Analysis of State Statutes and Cases s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nCollect Statutes/Reaulatio ns throuah WestLaw \nStatute and Reaulation Analvsis \nCollect Case Law throuah Westlaw \nCase Law Comparison and Analvsis \nCross Comparison of Case Law/Statutes/Survey Results \nDissemination at Conferences \nYear4 \nAim 2b: Legal Analysis of State Statutes and Cases s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nPreparation of Law Review \nAim 3a and 3b: Policv ODtions s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nIdentification of Policv Options from Aims 1 and 2 \nPolicv Analysis 3a \nIdentification of Actuarial Standards from Aims 1 and 2 \nPolicv Analysis 3b \nDissemination at Conferences \nYears \nAim 3b: Actuarial Justification Standards Policv ODtions s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nPreparation of Policv Brief(s) \nPreparation of Manuscript \nDissemination at Conferences \nGrant Aoolications for Continued Independent Research \nResearch Strategy Page 94 ",

      "content": "Dr. Juan B. Gutiérrez,\n\nI am Gutierrez_NIH_Gerardo, your AI assistant. Below is a structured NIH-style analysis of the grant application text you provided, following the NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not Specified: Presumed focus on the legal, actuarial, and policy landscape of supplemental insurer use of genetic information]\n\n**PI:** Anya Prince  \n**Activity Code:** [Assumed K99/R00—transitional award]\n\n---\n\n### **Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)**\n**Assessment:**  \nThe proposed project addresses a complex and underexplored policy area—how life, long-term care, and disability (supplemental) insurers use genetic information, focusing on requirements for actuarial justification both domestically and internationally. U.S. policy debates to date have typically not differentiated by the predictive value or clinical actionability of genetic variants, nor have they systematically considered how actuarial standards should apply. The project responds directly to NHGRI-identified ELSI priorities, which include determination of actuarial risk and implications of state laws. It aims to fill gaps that have led to patient and research participant fears and to fluctuating policy practices.\n\n**Innovation** is present in the methodology (integrating international policy case studies, a comprehensive 50-state legal review, and primary data from insurance commissioners) and in the focus on how, not just whether, genetic data should be used by supplemental insurers. The plan to train students through experiential learning is a secondary but notable contribution.\n\n**Score (1–9):** 2  \n**Justification:**  \nThe work is highly significant, directly targets existing policy and social gaps, leverages comparative analysis, and could substantially affect both policy and public perceptions. The dual focus on both law and practice (actuarial justification, policy recommendations) adds further value.\n\n---\n\n### **Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)**\n**Assessment:**  \nThe applicant provides detailed aims and methodological plans:\n- **Aim 1:** Comparative qualitative case studies of four countries, combining document analysis and interviews with diverse stakeholders. Includes pilot feasibility stage.\n- **Aim 2:** Multi-method U.S. legal analysis—state insurance commissioner surveys (with demonstrated feasibility in prior work) and extensive legal research across statutes, regulation, and case law.\n- **Aim 3:** Policy analysis integrating gathers evidence, with feedback from national experts.\n\nThe design includes explicit steps for data triangulation, alternative strategies if recruitment or analysis stalls, and reliance on prior collaborator networks. Training in qualitative methods and a plan for student involvement support capacity.\n\n**Potential risks** include the challenge of cross-national comparisons (ensuring relevance, adjusting for system differences), and the demanding scope of a 50-state legal analysis, but contingency plans (limiting sample size, shifting cases) are provided.\n\n**Human subjects:**  \nThe proposal involves stakeholder interviews but is non-biomedical, with minimal associated risk and clear plans for participant recruitment and confidentiality.\n\n**Score (1–9):** 3  \n**Justification:**  \nThe methodology is sound, well-justified, and leverages established qualitative and legal research practices. The proposed alternative strategies for potential barriers, plus strong preliminary justification, support feasibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)**\n**Assessment:**  \nThe PI demonstrates background in law, public policy, prior network connections (especially in Canada and Europe), mentorship support, and explicit training plans in qualitative methods and policy analysis. Institutional resources (access to databases, legal/statutory resources, law students for data collection) appear adequate.\n\n**Sufficient**\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Review Criteria (affect overall impact but not scored)**\n- **Human Subjects:**  \n  Minimal risk—stakeholder interviews only. Comprehensive plan for recruitment and confidentiality.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:**  \n  Not specified/applicable.\n\n### **Additional Considerations (do not affect score)**\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n  The use of legal databases, international policy documents, and interview-based research is justified; plans for data verification (triangulation) are included.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:**  \n  Not directly discussed but scope seems reasonable for K99/R00 timeframe; reliance on student researchers efficiently leverages limited resources.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Impact Score (1–9)**\n**Score:** 2  \n**Justification:**  \nThis is a compelling, timely, and well-constructed proposal. The combination of comparative international and comprehensive U.S. legal analysis positions the research to provide actionable policy options at the intersection of law, actuarial practice, and genomics. It directly addresses ELSI and policy translation gaps that currently hamper clinical genome adoption due to insurance fears. Minor feasibility and scope risks are mitigated by strong alternative plans. The outcomes—policy briefs, legal analysis, and stakeholder-informed guidance—are likely to have a sustained impact on policy makers, regulators, and the genomics community.\n\n---\n\nIf you would like a vulnerability analysis or further refinement (per the NIH framework reflection cycle), please let me know.",

      "content": "Please analyze the following document:\n\nSuccessfully extracted text from PDF:\n\n--- Page 1 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nSpecific Aims: \nIn the US, there has been a polarized debate about whether life, long-term care, and disability insurers, \nreferred to as 'supplemental' insurers, should be able to use an applicant's genetic information when setting \nrates or accepting policies. This debate usually references highly predictive and serious genetic diseases, such \nas Huntington's Disease or Lynch Syndrome. In reality, most variants have a wide range of predictive values, \nfrom unknown to low to high. There has been little debate about how predictive a variant must be for \nsupplemental insurers to use-or to be legally allowed to use-the information . Additionally , for some highly \npredictive variants, medical interventions may be available to minimize one's indicated risk, and the law does \nnot currently shed light on how insurers should consider this information . State unfair trade practice laws \ngenerally require insurers to have actuarial justification for using any risk factor in underwriting . Under these \nactuarial laws, to deny an application or charge an increased premium, insurers must show that a relevant risk \nfactor is statistically associated with increased insurer cost. However, in the US, there has been little research \nregarding the application of these standards to genetic and genomic data. Internationally , several countries, \nsuch as the UK and Australia, have had actuarial policies for supplemental insurers specific to genetic testing \nsince the early 2000s. Thus, most of the academic and policy discussions in this area have occurred abroad. \nAlthough the Genetic Information Nondiscriminat ion Act (GINA) protects against genetic discrimination in \nemployment and health insurance , individuals may fail to undertake medically recommended clinical genetic \ntesting, or participate in genomic research, due to fears of discrimination in supplementa l insurance. Policy \nresponses tend to focus on whether supplemental insurers should be able to use genetic information , but do \nnot explore the broader criteria that inform when and how such information can legally be used. Once studied, \nthese criteria can inform a more nuanced policy discussion of the 'should'. This project has two primary goals: \n1) to systematically examine the legal and policy landscape of supplemental insurer use of genetic information \nin the US and internationally, with particular focus on requirements of actuarial justification; and 2) to use these \nrequirements to offer a variety of policy options for US state and federal governments that seek to address \ngenetic discrimination in supplemental insurance. To meet these goals, I propose three specific aims. \nAim 1 -Analyze how international approaches to actuarial justification , supplemental insurance , and genetic \ninformation may be applicable to the US. Using methods and analysis techniques acquired during the \nmentored-phase, I will choose four countries that have robust policies regarding actuarial justification and \ninsurer use of genetic information and conduct case studies of these examples . Focus on actuarial standards \nin the international privatized supplemental insurance sector ensures a more direct comparison with the US, \ndespite differences across health insurance sectors. I will explore why specific policy options were chosen, \nwhether these policies address issues related to predictive value or preventive measures , how effective the \npolicies have been, and what lessons were learned. Case study analysis will combine both policy analysis and \ntargeted interviews with key stakeholders such as academic/policy experts, government officials, advocacy \ngroup representat ives, and insurance representatives . \nAim 2 -Interrogate how existing US state laws that require actuarial justification in supplemental insurance \nwould apply to use of genetic information . Using multiple methods, I will explore how current state law may \napply to genetic information. I will conduct a survey of US state insurance commissioners to examine how they \nare interpreting and enforcing actuarial and unfair trade practice laws (Aim 2a). I will combine this with legal \nanalysis of statutes, regulations , and applicable case law to evaluate whether state law has been applied to the \ncontext of genetic information and how the laws may be interpreted and enforced in this area (Aim 2b ). Survey \nresponses will inform the legal analysis of how existing legislation may be enforced or interpreted . \nAim 3 -Provide policy analysis and recommendations for legislative and regulatory options to address \nconcerns about the use of genetic information in supplemental insurance. I will undertake policy analysis of \noptions available to US governments to address societal and individual concerns about supplemental insurer \nuse of genetic information (Aim 3a). Additional policy analysis will explore legal and policy options for the \nthreshold evidence levels needed to meet actuarial standards (Aim 3b ). These options will incorporate \nfeedback from policy experts. I will dissemina te recommendations through policy briefs and manuscripts. \nAims 1 and 2a (K99 phase) will be completed in concert with training in qualitative and quantitative methods. \nFor the R00 phase, my goal is to secure a tenured law position that involves teaching an experiential course \nand researching ELSI topics. Under this model, students will assist in the research goals of Aims 2b and 3. \nBy combining policy analysis and case studies from the international setting with detailed legal and survey \nanalysis from the US, this project will produce a robust study of potential policy options for legislators. \nSpecific Aims Page 87 \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nResearch Strategy \nSignificance \nImagine an individual who is known to have a genetic variant that was reported in a genome-wide association \nstudy (GWAS) to be weakly correlated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, a leading cause of \ndeath worldwide. Should life, long-term care, or disability insurance companies be able to use this information \nin underwriting decisions, even if the genetic variant only explains about 1-2% of variation in risk? What if the \nvariant explains 10% of risk? Or 80%? What if it explains 80% of risk, but there are measures that an individual \ncan take to eliminate or mitigate this risk? \nThere has been a long-standing debate in the US regarding whether life, long-term care, or disability insurers, \nshould be able to use genetic information in underwriting (Caulfield 2013, Joly 2013, Klitzman 2014, Ostrer \n1993, Rothstein 1997). I refer to these insurers as supplemental insurers, in that they are purchased in addition \nto health insurance. I do not refer to health policies, such as a Medicare supplemental policy, that an individual \nacquires in addition to his or her existing health insurance. The supplemental insurer debates have often \nremained entrenched in discussion about whether or not insurers should be able to use genetic information \n(Mittra 2007). There has been little research and policy discussion of, if supplemental insurers have access to \ngenetic information, when and how they should be able to use it in underwriting . This research project \nexamines how law and policy address, or should address, the threshold of statistical significance between \ngenetic information and increased risk necessary for insurers to charge higher premium rates or deny a policy. \nIn 2008, in response to the public's concerns of genetic discrimination, Congress passed the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). GINA prevents employers and health insurers from using genetic \ninformation to discriminate , but does not regulate how supplemental insurers use genetic information (McGuire \n2009). These insurers were not included in GINA due to political compromise and recognition that the \neconomic models and social goals of supplemental insurance raise different policy considerations than health \ninsurance (Hudson 2008). However, in the years since GINA's passage, individuals remain fearful of genetic \ndiscrimination in supplementa l insurance (Allain 2012, Laedtke 2012, Parkman 2014). This fear may lead \nindividuals not to undergo recommended clinical genetic testing or to decline participat ion in genomic research \n(Barlow-Stewart 2009, Feldman 2012, Joly 2010, Klitzman 2010, Peshkin 2013), potentially leading to \ndetrimental health effects for those who do not undertake clinically beneficial testing (Otlowski 2012). Failure to \nundergo predictive testing for a medically actionable condition due to fear of discriminatory consequences \ncould thwart an individual from preventing or mitigating disease. \nSince federal law does not address supplemental insurer use of genetic information, any US-based policy in \nthis area currently comes from state law. Several states address insurer use of genetic information (NCSL \n2008). Three states are commonly cited as banning supplemental insurer use of genetic information (Peikoff \n2014 ); in fact, these states do not completely prohibit insurer use, but rather, they prohibit use of family \nmembers' genetic information (O.R.S 2001, V.S.A. 1997) or have actuarial requirements for the use (Cal-GINA \n2011, Chabner 2000). Requiring actuarial justification for use of genetic information in underwriting decisions , \nsuch as premium increases or denials, is a common legislative strategy. These laws generally require that \ninsurers demonstrate statistical correlation between a risk and an increased likelihood of cost to the insurer \n(ASOP 2005, Jha 2012, Landes 2014). The interpretation, enforcement, and implementation of these actuarial \nlaws, however, have not been fully analyzed. It is therefore surprisingly unclear how existing state laws have \nbeen or will be applied in the context of the predictive value and preventive measures of genetic variants. \nRecent technological advances have drastically lowered the cost of sequencing , making genomic analysis \npotentially affordable for insurers. This information may be beneficial to insurers since underwriting involves \ncategoriz ing applicants into risk classifications and genetic information can provide insight into future risk (Van \nHoyweghen 2007). However, the use of genetic information also raises social concerns beyond the business \nconsiderations of insurers (Dubois 2011, Liukko 2010, Morris 2010, Moultrie 1997, Van Hoyweghen 2005, Van \nHoyweghen 2012). For example, some, including myself, have argued or suggested that in order to fully \naddress individual fears of genetic discrimination, supplementa l insurers should be restricted from using \ngenetic information (Ashcroft 2007, Gruber 2014, Klitzman 2014, Prince 2013, Wolf 2007). Others have argued \nthat this would bankrupt the insurance system because it will skew risk classification and lead to adverse \nselection (Baker 2002, Dodge 2007, Green 2015, Joly 2010, Radetzki 2003, Rothstein 2004); yet there is little \nResearch Strategy Page 88 \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nempirical evidence of any effects of adverse selection following policy changes (Daykin 2003) and actuarial \nmodeling has indicated low impacts on premiums (Macdonald 2011; 201 0; 2003, Viswanathan 2007). The \ncompeting economic concerns of insurers and the privacy and justice concerns of individuals create polarizing \ninterests and lead to an entrenched debate over insurers' use of genetic information (Joly 2010). \nThis proposed project is significant because it will provide policy-makers with in-depth analysis of policy and \nregulatory options and recommendations for how life, long-term care, and disability insurers use genetic \ninformation. The NHGRI has specifically identified use of genetic information by these supplemental insurance \ncompanies, determination of actuarial risk, and the impact of state laws as priorities for ELSI legal, regulatory, \nand public policy research (NHGRI 2014 ). Genomic technolog ies will not rise to their full clinical potential if fear \nof discriminat ion or misunderstanding of existing legal protections prevents individuals from undertaking \ngenomic testing or participating in research. This project highlights lessons from international contexts; \nanalyzes existing state legislation; and provides policy recommendations for future legislatures. Existing state \nlaws offer an opportunity to suggest policy changes through a variety of mechanisms , from enforcement \nstrategies to regulatory changes to new legislation. Providing meaningfu l and feasible policy options and a \nbetter understanding of how insurers can legally use genetic information can make several contributions : \nassuage fears of genetic discrimination , increase participation in genomic testing and research, and potentially \nprevent significant barriers in access to supplemental insurance . In turn, increased insurance coverage and \nutilization of genomic technologies can lead to greater economic stability and improved health for individuals. \nInnovation \nThis proposal is original in its approach to the question of whether supplemental insurers should be able to use \ngenetic information. By beginning the inquiry with how insurers can fairly or legally use such information , rather \nthan if they should use it at all, this project can provide new insight to an entrenched US debate. Focusing on \nhow international actuarial standards have been applied to genetic and genomic risk information allows this \nproject to draw lessons from countries with distinct socio-historical contexts. Additionally, the proposed \nresearch project is innovative in the way that it combines legal and policy analysis with social science empirical \nanalysis in a law school setting. Use of an experiential course model increases the amount of research that \ncan be undertaken with the same amount of funding because students will provide research assistance as part \nof their experiential learning. Through this novel approach, I can simultaneously increase my chances of \nsecuring a position as an independent researcher, increase the impact of the project given the increased \nresearch that can be completed, and establish a mechanism to train future ELSI legal scholars. The proposal is \nalso novel in its recognition of the importance of mentorsh ip in the R00 phase and the inclusion of a specific \nprofessional development component on mentorship within the training plan. \nApproach \nAim 1: Analyze how international approaches to actuarial justification , supplemental insurance , and genetic \ninformation may be applicable to the US. \nAim 1 Rationale: Several countries have long established policies that impose actuarial justification standards \nor regulate supplemental insurers in the context of genetic information . Because these countries often have \nuniversal health care systems that limit concerns of discrimination and access in the health care setting, policy \ndiscussions regarding concerns about genetic discrimination have focused on the supplemental insurances \nthat are often privatized (Anderlik 2001, Knoppers 2004b). Compared to the US, these countries are generally \nmore advanced in policy implementation in the context of supplemental insurance (Van Hoyweghen 2007). \nThere are three primary avenues that countries have used to address supplemental insurer use of genetic \ninformation (Knoppers 2004a, Lemmens 2003), although within these broad strategies there are a variety of \ntypes of policies (Joly 2010, Lemke 2013, Otlowski 2012, Quinn 2014, Varga 2012). First, insurers in some \ncountries have voluntarily agreed to a moratorium on the use of genetic information for applications below a \ncertain monetary value and to a requirement of actuarial justification for those above that value (Huijgen 2012, \nSoini 2012). For example, since 2001, supplemental insurers in the United Kingdom have had a voluntary \nmoratorium , which was just recently extended to 2019 (HMG 2011, Thomas 2012). Second, some countries \nhave passed legislation at the federal level requiring actuarial justification in this area (Soini 2012, Van \nHoyweghen 2012). Utilizing this strategy, Australia has legislation that requires certain supplemental insurers \nto have actuarial justification for using genetic information (ALRC 2003, Keogh 2013, Taylor 2004 ). Third, \nResearch Strategy Page 89 \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nsome countries have informal guidelines from a government advisory or regulatory body (Knoppers 2004a, \nLemmens 2004). In these countries the guidance may not be legally binding on the insurers. \nExploration of the effectiveness of these approaches in the international context can provide lessons for policy \nimplementation in the US. Although US states do have actuarial laws, there has not been robust policy \ndiscussion regarding how these laws may be enforced. As such, examining the international context first, \nwhere there have been debates, can inform the nuanced legal analysis of Aim 2. Although the health insurance \nsystems across international contexts vary, the privatized supplemental insurance context provides a more \ndirectly comparable perspective to the US (Rothstein & Joly 2009). Specific focus on the standards of actuarial \njustification and the threshold levels of evidence needed to use genetic information in supplemental insurance \nunderwriting also allows for an opportunity to gather lessons from international countries that have already \nbeen grappling with these nuances for many years, but without insurmountab le concerns of applicability from \ndiffering socio-historical contexts. Through qualitative case studies of internationa l experiences , Aim 1 will \nprovide valuable information for the US-based policy analysis of Aims 2 and 3 of this project. Case study \nmethods offer not only in-depth analysis of the individual cases but also analytic strategies for systematically \ncomparing patterns observed across cases (Ragin 1999, Ragin 2014, Stake 2013, Yin 2003). \nAim 1 Methods: Aim 1 will utilize a qualitative , comparative case study analysis to explore how actuarial \njustification laws and policies in four countries have been applied to the use of genetic information in \nunderwriting. Data sources include semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and analysis of policy \ndocuments, such as government reports or legislation, legislative history, internal government or insurance \ncommunications , legal case documents, and academic critiques or manuscripts regarding the policies. Each \ncase study will utilize these multiple sources of data to allow for triangulation (Stake 2013, Yin 2003). \nInitially I plan to conduct a pilot case study in Canada in order to test my interview protocol, determine the most \nefficient and effective ways to recruit stakeholders and collect data, and to confirm the feasibility of my case \nstudy methods. Canada is a fitting pilot study due to the proximity to the US, the robust discussions regarding \nactuarial justification policies that have occurred in the country to date (Joly 2006, Joly 2014, Lemmens 2010, \nPullman 2010), and the support of a key stakeholder to assist with the identification and recruitment of other \nstakeholders (See Joly Support Letter). Canada has published guidance on use of genetic information in life \ninsurance (Knoppers 2004b) and the legislature is currently considering a bill to ban insurer use of genetic \ninformation (Rennie 2013). Additionally, at the beginning of the project, I will undertake a screening process to \nselect the remaining three purposively sampled cases (Yin 2003). These countries will be chosen to include \nrepresentation of the three primary policy tactics (moratorium, legislation, or guidelines) utilized around the \nworld. Cases will be selected that have had at least one policy mechanism in place for five years or more, have \nstakeholders with English language skills, and have similarities to the US for comparison. \nI will explore the following research questions for each case study: \n• Why was the particular policy option chosen in this country? \n• How effective has the policy been, as judged by the stakeholders? \n• How has the actuarial justification policy been applied to genetic information , specifically regarding the \npredictive value of genetic variants and the availability of preventive measures? \n• Have there been any consequences, unexpected or expected , of the policy, and if so, what are they? \n• From the stakeholders ' perspectives, has the policy affected how often either individuals undertake \ngenetic or genomic testing or apply for supplemental insurance? \nDocument Collection: Initially, I will collect policy documents and analysis available online through government \nwebsites and searches of academic databases such as LexisNexis, JSTOR, and PubMed. The CGS summer \nlegal research assistant will assist with this task. However, since the availability of international documents \nmay be limited in the US, I will also establish meetings with government and research librarians in the case \nstudy countries to gather additional relevant documents unavailable in the US. During each interview, I will also \nask the respondents for suggestions of documents the respondent thinks might be informative to the study. \nInterviews : Employing the skills I will acquire through focused trainings on qualitative interview design, I will \ncreate and conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (King 2010). For each case study I will \ninterview at least 8 stakeholders representing policy experts, government officials, advocacy group members , \nand insurance representatives. To the extent possible in each country I will speak to at least two stakeholders \nResearch Strategy Page 90 \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nfrom each category. This targeted interviewing of a diverse group of stakeholders is important for minimizing \nsingle-source information bias, maximizing the range of perspectives , and collecting differential knowledge \n(Van de Ven 1999). These stakeholders will be identified through help from my international contacts (See De \nPaor, Joly, and Macdonald Letters), policy documents and research, and suggestions from individuals who \nhave agreed to be interviewed . Although this approach has the potential to create a participant population \nskewed to one perspective, this will not be likely since the nature of policy discussions inevitably highlight \ndiverse opinions. Therefore, already identified policy-makers and key stakeholders are likely to know, and will \nbe asked to identify, individuals with a broad range of perspectives and opinions. They will be enrolled through \na recruitment letter and follow-up phone call. I will pilot test my data collection protocol and semi-structured \ninterview guide in Canada, and then conduct the three additional case studies. Interviews will be conducted in \nperson to ensure convenience for the participants, quality of the interview, minimization of technological \ncomplications, and ease of document collection pre and post-interview (See Foreign Justification). \nData Analysis: I will undertake content analysis of the interview transcripts utilizing software, such as ATLAS.ti, \nthat aids in this kind of analysis. I will be trained in content analysis through classes at the Odum Institute, \nAALS Qualitative Workshop, and Research Talk. I will also pursue my analysis by comparing the content of the \npolicy documents collected with the themes extracted from the interviews. \nAim 1 Expected and Alternative Outcomes: For each country studied I will develop a written overview that \nincludes: 1) a descriptive summary of the policy method(s) implemen ted and the context in which it was \nimplemented , 2) a description of how actuarial justification standards have been applied to genetic information , \n3) an overview of how effective the policy has been according to documents and interview respondents, and 4) \nan assessment of the benefits and challenges of each policy. After individual case analysis, I will perform a \ncross-case analysis, examining whether the application of actuarial justification standards differs across policy \noptions. To disseminate these research findings I will publish at least one manuscript summarizing the case \nstudy research findings. Additionally, I will present my findings at national conferences such as the American \nSociety for Bioethics and Humanities (ASBH) and the Law and Society Association (LSA). \nInternational policy analysis and recruitmen t for interviews can be challenging; however, I believe that I will be \nable to recruit adequate numbers of interview participants. There is robust scholarship regarding actuarial \njustification policies and genetic information in the international setting, making it likely that I can find willing \nand interested participants to discuss the implications of these policies. Additionally , through my previous work \nand through support of my advisory committee members , Ors. De Paor and Macdonald , I have connections to \nthe European genetics communities , and through my collaborator Dr. Joly, the Canadian community (See \nSupport Letters). Thus, I will be able to reach out to a variety of contacts for suggestions of key stakeholders . \nBy undertaking a pilot feasibility case study and by waiting to choose the remaining three case study countries \nuntil the project is underway, I can foresee and avoid problems related to recruitment of stakeholders or \nconducting the case studies. If I am unable to gather sufficient research participant interest in a country, I will \nchoose a different option for the case study. Additionally , if the Canadian pilot study highlights problems with \nthe initial case study design I can rework the protocol with support from mentors for the remaining cases. \nAim 2 -Interrogate how existing US state laws that require actuarial justification in supplemental insurance \nwould apply to use of genetic information \nAim 2 Rationale: Under state unfair trade practice laws, life insurers in all fifty states are required to have \nactuarial justification to use a risk factor in underwriting (Holmes 1996, McEwen 1993, UTPA 2004 ). Some \nstates have expanded these rules to disability and long-term care insurers (Avraham 2014). In addition, eight \nstates explicitly require actuarial justification for the use of genetic information in underwriting (NCSL 2008). \nThese laws aim to restrict supplemental insurers from basing underwrit ing decisions on genetic information \nthat is unrelated to risk. However, the genetic-specific actuarial justification laws likely do not provide any \nadditional protections for individuals beyond the broader unfair trade practice laws (Rothstein 2007). \nThese state laws, both the genetic-specific and general unfair trade practice laws, have not been fully explored \nand further research is needed to understand how these rules will be applied in the context of genetic variants. \nGiven the range of predictive value of genetic variants, it is uncertain how many will be sufficiently correlated to \nrisk to meet actuarial standards (Evans 2001, Janssens 2006, Macdonald 2002) and how the preventive \nmeasures available to mitigate risk will and should fit into the legal actuarial standards (Keogh 2013). Although \nResearch Strategy Page 91 \n\n--- Page 6 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \ninsight into these questions will come from the international data obtained in Aim 1, it is also important to \nunderstand how the US state laws are being applied, and most significantly, could be applied, in this context. \nInsurance companies, including life, long-term care, and disability insurers, are regulated through state \ninsurance commissioners and in every state the insurance commissioner has the power to enforce state \ninsurance laws and promulgate regulation (Randall 2008). The commissioner offices also provide services to \nconsumers of these insurances through information and complaint systems (NAIC 2011 ). Through their work \nwith both insurers and consumers, the insurance commissioners are an essential source of information for how \nactuarial justification laws are being used. Through surveys of state insurance commissioners, and legal \nanalysis of state law, regulation , and court cases, Aim 2 will provide an opportunity to better understand how \nactuarial justification and unfair trade practice laws are currently being enforced and implemented in the US. \nAim 2 Methods: Aim 2 will employ multiple methods to analyze US actuarial justification laws and will involve \ntwo sub-aims: Aim 2a will survey state insurance commissioners to determine how they are enforcing and \ninterpreting actuarial justification laws; based on survey results, Aim 2b will undertake a legal analysis of \ncurrent state actuarial justification and unfair trade practice laws. There are already a handful of cursory state \nlaw reviews that will inform the survey (CLRC 2012, CRG 2014, NCSL 2008). I am proposing to undertake the \nin-depth legal analysis after the surveys in order to conduct a more nuanced and detailed legal analysis. \nSurvey: For Aim 2a, I will develop and implement a survey of state insurance commissioners about actuarial \nand unfair trade practice laws and how the commissioners interpret and enforce these laws. The survey will \nfocus on genetic information, the low predictive value of most variants, and the preventive measures available \nfor some genetic variants. Surveys and interviews of insurance commissioners have been used in prior studies \nto understand how health and life insurers could use genetic information, including a case study analysis \ncompleted by my co-mentor Prof. Hall (Hall 2000a, Hall 2000b, Hall 2000c, McEwen 1992). Aim 2a survey \nquestions will be developed in concert with feedback from mentors and based on survey methodology trainings \nundertaken through the Odum Institute. In addition to questions on how current state laws are interpreted and \nenforced, the survey will include questions that draw upon policy themes discovered during Aim 1. It will \ninclude both closed and open-ended questions surrounding these themes. The surveys will be sent to all state \ncommissioners and follow-up letters and phone calls will be made to reach state offices that have not \nresponded . In a prior study surveying state commissioners, this method was found to lead to a remarkably high \nresponse rate (82.4%) (McEwen 1992). The CGS legal research assistant will assist with survey analysis and \nfollow-up on any laws cited by the commissioners. To disseminate the survey results, I will publish findings in \npeer-reviewed journals, and use the information about enforcement and interpretation to assist with the legal \nanalysis of Aim 2b. Additionally, I will present my work at national conferences such as ASBH and LSA. \nLegal Analysis: For Aim 2b, I will conduct a fifty state review of laws, regulations, and court case decisions \n(case law) relating to actuarial justification , both genetic-specific and broader unfair trade practice laws. I will \nspecifically explore whether and how actuarial standards are defined and whether genetic-specific actuarial \njustification laws provide, or potentially provide, protections beyond those the state unfair trade practice laws. If \nthe plain text of the statute or regulation is unclear, I will employ statutory interpretation methodology I learned \nwhen I took the \"Lawmaking and Statutory Interpretation Seminar\" taught by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes­\nNorton. This state review will provide a comprehensive guide to which state laws apply to which supplemental \ninsurers. Several organizations have completed state guides regarding state laws covering genetic information \nin supplemental insurance (CLRC 2012, CRG 2014, NCSL 2008) and other sources have information on state \nunfair trade practice laws (Avraham 2014, Holmes 1996); however no study has combined information about \nhow all these laws may work in practice, with specific focus on whether and how actuarial standards are \ndefined. These previous guides will form my starting data points, so my initial data collection will involve \nupdating available cites, rather than a new search. In addition to this background analysis of state laws and \nregulations, Aim 2b will use legal analysis to examine applicable case law to evaluate whether state law has \nbeen used in the context of genetic information and how the laws may be interpreted and enforced in this area. \nBoth the state statutes and the case law will be compiled through searches of WestlawNext , a legal database. \nThe specific questions of inquiry in the case law analysis will include: \n• Is there any case law explicitly addressing genetic information and actuarial justification or unfair trade \npractice laws? \nResearch Strategy Page 92 \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \n• Does past case law define or discuss actuarial standards or address what level of statistical correlation is \nnecessary for insurers to use risk factor information in underwriting? \n• How might precedential case law regarding medical information or disability be applied in the context of \ngenetic information? \n• Is there any case law that discusses how supplemental insurers should take into account mitigating risk \nfactors, such as available preventive measures? \nAim 2 Expected and Alternative Outcomes: Aim 2a will culminate in at least one published manuscript \nsummarizing the state insurance commissioner survey design, methodology, and results. To disseminate the \ninformation from Aim 2b I will complete a published law review article describing the findings of the statute, \nregulation, and case law analysis. I am expecting to find that the genetic-specific actuarial justification laws do \nnot provide any additional legal protections beyond state unfair trade practice laws. Additionally, I am expecting \nthat few cases will explicitly address genetic information in this arena. However, because the genetic-specific \nand unfair trade practice laws are likely similar, case law regarding how unfair trade practice laws have applied \nto other medical information provides important legal precedent for how future courts will apply these laws to \nthe context of genetic information. \nAnalysis of statutes in fifty states can be time consuming to complete and, depending upon the volume of \napplicable or precedential case law, the case analysis can also be time consuming. However, these tasks of \nAim 2b will be completed during the R00 phase of the project. During this phase, my goal is to have students \nassist with the data collection and analysis as part of their experiential class. This model will allow for sufficient \nresearch support to complete the full fifty state analysis. If, however, I am unable to secure this teaching \nopportunity and/or do not have sufficient research support to analyze the case law and statutes from all states, \nI plan to limit the number of states that I examine to a representative sample. \nAim 3 -Provide policy analysis and recommendat ions for legislative and regulatory options to address \nconcerns about the use of genetic information in supplemental insurance . \nAim 3 Rationale: Since the passage of GINA, there has been discussion of whether the federal government \nshould pass additional legislation that expands protection against genetic discrimination in supplemental \ninsurances. There are strong competing interests on both sides of this debate: Individuals fear the misuse of \ntheir genetic information and supplemental insurers fear the economic consequences and adverse selection in \ntheir businesses (Daykin 2003, Haidle 2014, Macdona ld 2002, Rothstein & Joly 2009). These competing views \ncreate difficult policy decisions for state and federal legislators. However, international and US state \nexperiences to date can provide valuable insight into the feasibility , implications, and benefits of various policy \noptions. Aim 3 of this project will synthesize information and data collected through Aims 1 and 2 to create \npolicy analyses and reports of various options, including the moratorium , legislative, and guideline options from \nthe international context. Aims 1 and 2 will help to better understand the varying interpretations of the levels of \nevidence needed to meet actuarial justification and unfair trade practice laws. From there, Aim 3 can provide \npolicy guidance to state insurance commissioners , state legislators , individuals , insurance companies , and \nadvocates about enforcement, interpretations, and legal uses of genetic information in underwriting . \nAim 3 Methods: Using policy analysis skills I developed during my graduate training in my Masters of Public \nPolicy, Aim 3 will include two levels of policy analysis and inquiry. First, Aim 3a will be a policy analysis of the \nlegislative options available at the federal and state level to address supplemental insurer use of genetic \ninformation, ranging from status quo to a complete ban on use, and other options in between. The analysis will \ninclude an assessment of the potential limitations, benefits, and feasibility of various policy options. \nThe policy analysis will explore the following questions : \n• Do current state policies effectively address supplemental insurer use of genetic information? \n• Is additional , or different, enforcement of current state laws needed to afford effective protection? \n• Would any of the policy mechanisms implemented in the international context be options for US federal or \nstate governments? \n• What are the limitations, benefits, and feasibility of various policy options? \nSecond, Aim 3b will assess how both international case studies and the states define evidence thresholds for \nthe necessary level of statistical correlation to use genetic information in underwriting. I will conduct policy \nResearch Strategy Page 93 \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Prince, Anya \nanalysis of these varying interpretations and actuarial definitions to assess the implications of various evidence \nthresholds. If there have not been clear evidence thresholds or if the thresholds are consistent, I will assess the \nimplications of what the threshold could or should be. This will provide policy makers, insurance companies, \ninsurance commissioners , and individuals undergoing genetic testing guidance on when and how genetic \ninformation can and should legally be used for underwriting. In order to receive feedback and suggestions on \nvarious policy options, I will vet options with US policy experts, such as Dr. Koontz, my advisory committee \nmember, to discuss issues of actuarial justification , genetic information, and supplemental insurance. \nAs with Aim 2b, the research of Aim 3 will be completed within the RO0 portion of the grant; therefore my goal \nis to complete this research within the context of the experiential class at a law school. The assistance of \nstudents in the legal and policy analysis creates the ability to increase the output of policy analysis to potential \nstate-specific white papers or other in-depth policy analysis given findings from the previous Aim(s). \nAim 3 Expected and Alternative Outcomes: Aim 3 will culminate in a series of policy briefs, or white papers, \nthat legislators at the federal and state levels can utilize. These briefs will be disseminated to the state \ninsurance commissioners who participated in Aim 2 in order to have maximum impact. Discussions and \nfeedback from policy experts will also be incorporated into the policy reports as well as compiled into a \nmanuscript summarizing the key recommendat ions of the group. I will write at least one law review or peer­\nreviewed journal article summariz ing the policy findings of the project in order to disseminate the information to \na wider audience . I will also attend conferences , such as ASBH and LSA, to present my work. \nAlthough Aim 3 will draw largely on the information gathered during Aims 1 and 2, the research and analysis of \nAim 3 is not dependent upon a certain outcome in the previous aims. Even in the unlikely event that there is \nlittle information gathered on the interpretation of actuarial and unfair trade practice laws, this absence of \nguidance still provides a critical opportunity to explore possible options for the future. \nSince the policy analysis of Aim 3 will occur in Years 4 and 5, it is possible that new state or federal legislation \nmay be passed before the final years of the grant. I will track any changes in policy throughout the grant \nperiod. If changes occur, the skills gained during the K99 training will allow me to alter the policy analysis as \nneeded. For example, if federal legislation addressing supplemental insurer use of genetic information is \npassed during the grant, I can conduct a case study of the new legislation to assess enforcement options, \nissues that can be addressed by ensuing regulation , and the potential effectiveness of the law. \nThrough detailed policy and case study analysis from the international setting and robust legal and survey \nanalysis from the US, my proposed K99/R00 will recommend potential policy options for supplemental insurer \nuse of genetic information , thus supporting and informing an important NHGRI ELSI research priority. \nR00 lndeoendent Phase Research Year3 \nAim 2b: Legal Analysis of State Statutes and Cases s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nCollect Statutes/Reaulatio ns throuah WestLaw \nStatute and Reaulation Analvsis \nCollect Case Law throuah Westlaw \nCase Law Comparison and Analvsis \nCross Comparison of Case Law/Statutes/Survey Results \nDissemination at Conferences \nYear4 \nAim 2b: Legal Analysis of State Statutes and Cases s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nPreparation of Law Review \nAim 3a and 3b: Policv ODtions s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nIdentification of Policv Options from Aims 1 and 2 \nPolicv Analysis 3a \nIdentification of Actuarial Standards from Aims 1 and 2 \nPolicv Analysis 3b \nDissemination at Conferences \nYears \nAim 3b: Actuarial Justification Standards Policv ODtions s 0 N D J F M A M J J A \nPreparation of Policv Brief(s) \nPreparation of Manuscript \nDissemination at Conferences \nGrant Aoolications for Continued Independent Research \nResearch Strategy Page 94 ",

I will conduct a structured NIH-style review using the NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework for the provided grant application by Anya Prince.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not specified – Focused on actuarial justification and legal/policy options for supplemental insurer use of genetic information]\n\n**PI:** Anya Prince  \n**Activity Code:** K99/R00 (NIH Pathway to Independence Award)\n\n---\n\n### Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The proposed research addresses a compelling and policy-critical question: under what circumstances, and with what evidentiary standards, should supplemental insurers (life, long-term care, and disability) be able to use genetic information in underwriting? The absence of clear US laws covering this issue perpetuates fear among patients regarding genetic discrimination, potentially reducing clinical adoption of genetic testing and participation in research. The proposal also highlights the lack of scholarship on which actuarial standards are (or should be) applied and draws on underutilized international policy models to inform US options.\n  \n  The scope reaches beyond abstract debate, seeking to codify the criteria for actuarial justification and to detail policy recommendations grounded in comparative case studies, legal analysis, and empirical data. Direct alignment with ELSI priorities and high relevance to stakeholders (legislators, insurers, patients) reinforce the significance.\n\n- **Innovation:**  \n  The focus on “how” (criteria/mechanisms for use) rather than “whether” insurers should use genetic data is a crucial reframing. Methodological innovation is present through integration of legal, policy, and empirical social science tools within an experiential law school model that leverages training of new scholars.\n\n- **Score (1–9):** 2  \n- **Justification:**  \n  The topic is highly timely, with strong potential to inform both national policy and public trust. Directly responds to gaps in both knowledge and actionable frameworks. Only minor caveats relate to generalizability of international comparisons and the pace of legislative uptake.\n\n---\n\n### Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n- **Assessment:**  \n  Methods are robust and explicitly described:\n  - **Aim 1:** Qualitative, comparative case studies in four international settings, including a pilot in Canada, combining document analysis and stakeholder interviews. Rationale for country selection and feasibility contingencies are provided.\n  - **Aim 2:** 50-state legal/regulatory review, survey of insurance commissioners with real-world precedent for response rates, legal interpretation, and designed fallback options if nationwide review proves infeasible.\n  - **Aim 3:** Policy analysis synthesizing findings and grounded in established MPP training.\n  Key strengths include the iterative, triangulated approach; planned experiential student involvement; and fallback plans to adapt scope as needed.\n  \n  Risks: The scope is ambitious, and student involvement may impact collection/analysis quality and speed. Stakeholder recruitment and engagement, especially internationally, may pose unanticipated challenges despite existing networks. There is a clear plan for pilot testing and adapting study design as needed.\n\n- **Score (1–9):** 3  \n- **Justification:**  \n  Overall, the design is well-considered and feasible, with thoughtful alternative strategies for barriers. A minor deduction for the challenge of balancing ambitious scope with available resources and tight timelines.\n\n---\n\n### Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The PI shows strong expertise in legal and policy research, backed by advisory support and international contacts. The plan includes robust training in qualitative and policy methods (including content analysis software and established workshops), as well as explicit access to legal research tools and networks for recruitment.\n\n  The use of experiential legal education provides capacity but may pose supervision/quality challenges not directly addressed. Institutional support is implied (e.g., law school infrastructure), but explicit mention of administrative or data management support would further strengthen the case.\n\n- **Sufficient:**  \n  Adequate subject matter knowledge, mentorship, and preliminary plans for technical/institutional resources.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Review Criteria (unscored but affect overall impact)\n- **Human Subjects:**  \n  Involves minimal-risk interviews with professionals. No discussion of IRB status or data security/retention plans; these are required even for non-biomedical human subjects research.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:**  \n  Not a resubmission.\n\n### Additional Considerations (do not affect score)\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n  Use of widely accepted databases and structured qualitative coding; plans for multi-source triangulation, but would benefit from explicit data audit/tracking plans.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:**  \n  Ambitious scope for K99/R00 period, but leveraging of students and fallback plans for limiting sample size are in place.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Impact Score (1–9)\n- **Score:** 2  \n- **Justification:**  \n  An unusually comprehensive and timely proposal that addresses a persistent policy and social barrier in clinical genomics. If executed, it could have substantial policy impact and inform legislative, regulatory, and public dialogue. Some feasibility and logistics challenges remain, but the applicant has anticipated and planned for most. More detailed attention to human subjects protections and resource supervision would strengthen an already compelling project.\n\n---\n\nDr. Gutiérrez, if you would like a vulnerability analysis or further steps in the NIH review reflection cycle, please let me know.",

Below, I present a detailed NIH-style review that clearly enumerates both strengths and weaknesses for each scoring factor, as well as an integrated summary of overall impact. All reasoning is based on the content of the proposal and follows the NIH framework as instructed.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not specified – Focus on actuarial justification for supplemental insurer use of genetic information]\n\n**PI:** Anya Prince  \n**Activity Code:** K99/R00\n\n---\n\n### **Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Tackles a pressing policy gap in U.S. law and practice: the lack of clear statutory or regulatory guidance on when and how supplemental insurers (life, long-term care, and disability) may use genetic information.\n- Addresses real societal concern—as noted, the fear of genetic discrimination is inhibiting recommended genetic testing and research participation, leading to potential negative health and research outcomes.\n- Highly relevant to ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications) priorities identified by NHGRI; the project is likely to directly inform public policy and regulatory discussion.\n- Articulates the complexity of “predictive value” of genetic variants; moves beyond the binary “should/should not use” to the more nuanced “under what circumstances and evidence.”\n- Includes comparative analysis of countries with established policies, offering a potentially valuable toolkit of options for U.S. policymakers.\n- Contribution to stakeholder confidence, with meaningful translational potential if recommendations are adopted.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- There is limited discussion of the magnitude of the gap in current knowledge or of the likelihood that policy recommendations will be adopted, given the contentiousness and inertia typically seen in insurance regulation.\n- The generalizability of findings from international experiences may be limited by cultural, legal, and economic system differences not fully addressed in the proposal.\n- The stated significance is reliant on the downstream assumption that policy recommendations will translate into law or regulation within a reasonable timeframe, which historical evidence suggests may be optimistic.\n- The literature review alludes to the lack of prior work but provides limited direct critique of alternative frameworks or existing advocacy approaches (e.g., ongoing litigation, efforts by nonprofit groups) that could affect the relevance or impact of the findings.\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n---\n\n### **Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Methods are well described, with a clear rationale for each phase (international case studies, 50-state legal analysis, policy synthesis).\n- Pilot study in Canada to assess feasible protocols and adapt case methodology before expanding internationally demonstrates foresight and flexibility.\n- Detailed explanation of country and case selection criteria in Aim 1; direct comparison to U.S. context is attempted by focusing on privatized supplemental markets.\n- Multi-modal approach (document analysis plus interviews) and stakeholder diversity in interviews should help reduce bias.\n- Survey methods for state insurance commissioners are based on prior successfully executed work, giving some confidence in the approach.\n- Use of experiential law course for student involvement maximizes research capacity within K99/R00 constraints.\n- Multiple fallback plans offered (e.g., reducing state/country scope if recruitment or resources fail).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Scope is extremely ambitious—performing four international case studies, each with 8+ interviews and extensive document analysis, plus a meaningful 50-state legal analysis, all within a postdoctoral award period and with reliance on student researchers.\n- Student involvement, although resourceful, carries risk of variable data quality, turnover, and increased PI oversight requirements, not fully accounted for in the timeline or feasibility discussion.\n- No clear plans for ensuring consistency and reliability in interview coding/content analysis (e.g., inter-rater checks, double coding)—critical for qualitative rigor with multiple research assistants.\n- Although stakeholder recruitment is claimed to be feasible, international interviews (potential language/cultural barriers, variable buy-in) are notoriously unpredictable; contingency plans are general, not specific.\n- Human subjects protections receive little detail: the narrative lacks explicit plans for IRB review/exemption, interviewee consent, data retention, or confidentiality—requirements for NIH compliance even in minimal-risk research.\n- Response rates for state commissioner surveys may be overestimated due to administrative changes, regulatory sensitivities, and survey fatigue.\n- There is little discussion of potential legal/ethical risks associated with collecting sensitive regulatory and policy information, particularly in the international context.\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n---\n\n### **Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The PI demonstrates strong credentials in law and public policy, and prior international and domestic collaborations are already in place.\n- Advisory infrastructure includes key contacts in Europe and Canada; mentorship and content analysis/statutory interpretation training is part of the professional development plan.\n- Institutional supports such as legal databases are referenced; student involvement ensures a workforce for large-scale data and document review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Heavy reliance on law student research assistants means actual productivity could fluctuate (quality, time, independence) and likely requires substantial supervision and teaching effort from the PI.\n- While mentorship and networking are mentioned, explicit administrative support/logistical planning (e.g., interview transcription, data storage, software management, data sharing plans) are poorly articulated.\n- Resource management for large qualitative and legal datasets—especially if interview or documentary material is in other languages—may be underestimated.\n- Data security and management plans, crucial for sensitive policy interviews and multi-country studies, are not outlined.\n\n**Sufficient** (but close to the threshold due to potential scale/management risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Review Criteria (unscored but affect overall impact)**\n\n- **Human Subjects:** Minimal risk, but details of IRB protocol, data management, and confidentiality are missing or underdeveloped. No explicit discussion of compliance or data retention.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not a resubmission; no relevant discussion.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Considerations (do not affect score)**\n\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** Use of standard legal databases and analytic software (e.g., ATLAS.ti); lacks detail about audit trails or workflow for data integrity and reproducibility in student-led research.\n- **Budget/Period of Support:** Proposal is ambitious for a K99/R00 period, even with student labor. Potential for delays if student recruitment, retention, or training is not robust.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Impact Score (1–9)**\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis application expertly identifies and addresses a critical and complex gap in U.S. and global insurance law and genomics policy. The integration of comparative international case studies, comprehensive legal analyses, and actionable policy option development positions this work to fill a major void. The applicant’s expertise, international network, and capacity-building through experiential education are major assets. However, significant feasibility risks persist due to scope, student dependence, and somewhat underdeveloped plans for research management, human subjects protection, and operational logistics. The impact could be substantial if the project is properly resourced and managed; overall, the proposal is excellent but not without moderate risk, as reflected in the deduction from a perfect score.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n| Factor              | Strengths                                                                                                      | Weaknesses                                                                                   | Score/Rating      |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Importance          | Major and novel policy gap; high ELSI and public health relevance; innovative comparative approach.            | Generalizability, policy translation not assured, lacks full mapping of current alternatives. | 2                 |\n| Rigor & Feasibility | Pilot and contingency plans; multi-modal design; evidence-based methods.                                       | Very ambitious scope, reliance on students, underdeveloped qualitative rigor & IRB details.   | 3                 |\n| Expertise & Resources| Strong PI background/network; planned mentorship/training; institutional resources available.                  | Heavy student reliance, unclear resource/logistics management for scale and sensitivity.      | Sufficient        |\n\n---\n\nIf you wish to initiate the vulnerability analysis (Agent B) or request review refinement, please advise.",
