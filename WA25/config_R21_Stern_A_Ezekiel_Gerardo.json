Working with a dataset that contains 15,000 \nof these records from the period 1921 to 1952, and that comprises 25% of recorded eugenic sterilizations in \nthe United States, we seek to show the relevance of our historical findings to contemporary ethical, legal, and \nsocial issues in human genomics. Thousands of those sterilized under eugenic laws were deemed \"unfit\" \nbased on I.Q. scores and psychiatric classifications , or as delinquent due to their sexual behavior or petty \ncriminal records. While today reproductive autonomy is a cherished bioethical precept and a largely protected \nlegal right, we can learn a great deal from closely studying an era in which a particular variant of genetic \ndeterminism resulted in the state-mandated deprivation of reproductive capacity. \nOur specific aims are: \n1. To conduct extensive quantitative analysis using the eugenic sterilization dataset we have created during \nthe pilot phase of this project. This de-identified HIPAA-compliant dataset was created using REDCap and \nincludes 212 discrete variables for each of the 15,000 records. Using this wealth of coded data, we intend \nto describe patterns of sterilization according to gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, and diagnosis, as well \nas contextual factors such as patient's institution, medical superintendent , and family structure. \n2. To link the eugenic sterilization dataset to individual-level census microdata and tract-level census reports \nto permit population-based estimates of sterilization rates. By linking the two datasets we will be able to \ntest the associations of gender, age, ethnicity, nationality , diagnosis and other variables with the risk of \nsterilization . For example, we hypothesize that Spanish-surnamed patients and young teenagers were \ndisproportionately sterilized. Preliminary data analysis confirms this hypothesis for one institution , and we \nwish to test this hypothesis and a larger set of hypotheses related to social bias in and across institutions . \n3. To conduct qualitative analysis with the sterilization records, supplemental files, charts, and forms in the \ndigitized microfilm reels. Once our eugenic sterilization dataset is completed in summer 2015, we will be \nable perform keyword searches to identify themes, such as familial resistance to sterilization or patient \nrefusals, and to trace terminology trends over time. In addition, we will explore the meaning and limits of \nconsent in a context where sterilization was the precondition for institutional release. \n4. To incorporate our findings into a companion digital archive that features data visualization , historical \ninterpretation , and patient stories; this is under parallel development with digital humanities colleagues. \nWe will devote 24 months to quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dataset of 15,000 sterilization \nrecommendations (approximately 30,000 individual documents) that we have built with an internal pilot grant. \nWe will link the sterilization data to census microdata (individual-level data) constructed from the 1920, 1930, \nand 1940 censuses and tract-level data from the 1950 census, which will enable us to understand discrete and \nlongitudinal patterns of sterilization in and across state institutions. This rich data source provides a unique \nopportunity to conduct an empirical analysis of the practice of eugenics in the United States coupled with an \ninformative textual analysis of state-institutional practices. The companion digital archive will create an \nimportant historical resource for future researchers. \nDuring Year 1, we will create the census microdata set for all nine institutions under study; produce descriptive \nstatistics according to gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, diagnosis, and other variables; and conduct \npopulation-based quantitative analyses. In addition, we will undertake coding of the documents for the \nqualitative analysis of keywords and trends. We will submit abstracts to present our findings at public health, \nhistory, ethics, and ELSI community conferences , and begin to draft and outline peer-review articles. \nDuring Year 2 we will test hypotheses about increased risk of sterilization among particular subgroups by \ncombining the eugenic sterilization data set and the census microdata set. We will conduct our qualitative \nanalyses to analyze familial and patient objections to sterilization and to examine the limits of consent process \nin an institutional setting. We will prepare articles for peer review in scholarly journals and disseminate findings \nto history, public health, and ELSI communities . Relevant findings will inform a companion digital history \narchive under parallel development and for which we will apply for funding from humanities and history \nprograms. We will prepare articles for peer review in scholarly journals and continue to disseminate findings to \nhistory, public health, and ELSI communities . \nSpecific Aims Page 38 \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nRESEARCH STRATEGY \nSignificance \nDuring much of the twentieth century, eugenics was a popular \"science\" in much of the world (Bashford and \nLevine 2010). In its \"positive\" or softer form, eugenics manifested in activities such as better babies contests, \ninfant welfare programs , or pronatalist programs directed at groups deemed superior (Schneider 1990; Stepan \n1996; Kline 2001 ). In its more negative form, eugenics involved heavy-handed forms of reproductive control \nsuch as sterilization or mass euthanasia (Proctor 1988; Weindling 1989; Lombardo 2010; Black 2012; Hansen \nand King 2013). Genetic determinism undergirded both \"positive\" and \"negative\" eugenics although the former \nallowed greater latitude for environmental factors. From the 1900s through the 1960s, both variants of \neugenics influenced policies and attitudes on local and national levels in the United States (Paul 1995; Kevles \n1995; Largent 2008; Lombardo 2011 ). \nIndeed, many people are surprised to learn that in 1907 the Midwestern state of Indiana passed the world's \nfirst sterilization law, which authorized medical superintendents in homes and hospitals to sterilize people \nwhose deleterious heredity appeared to threaten society (Stern 2007). From this first law in 1907 to 1937, 32 \nU.S. states passed eugenic sterilization laws, which were used to control the reproduction of vulnerable \npopulations until the 1970s, when legislatures started to repeal these statutes. Over the period of about six \ndecades, over 60,000 sterilizations were officially recorded, principally in state homes and hospitals for the \nfeebleminded and mentally ill. Sterilization rates were fairly steady in the 191 Os and 1920s as eugenics gained \ncurrency, and increased markedly after 1927 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutiona lity of the \nprocedure in Buck v. Bell, a case that tested Virginia's 1924 law (Lombardo 2010). California passed the third \nlaw in the nation in 1909 and performed 1/3, or 20,000 of all documented sterilizations , the vast majority of \nthese between the 1920s and 1950s (Braslow 1997; Kline 2001; Stern 2005; Wellerstein 2011 ). \nThe broad contours of eugenic sterilization and coercive eugenics in the United States are familiar to many \nhistorians, geneticists, and bioethicists (Kelves and Hood 1993; Paul 1998; Buchanan et al. 2001; Andrews \n2002; Duster 2003; Mehlman 2009; McCabe and McCabe 2010; Comfort 2012) and it is not uncommon for \neugenic sterilization to be held up as an egregious example of early \"pseudoscientific \" human genetics. \nHowever, few empirical historical analyses of this practice are available. \n• Who was sterilized? \n• Were some groups disproport ionately sterilized? \n• Did racial or ethnic bias affect sterilization decisions and patterns? \n• Were age, gender, diagnosis, and nationality associated with a higher risk of sterilization? \n• How did sterilization practices and patterns change over time? \n• How did sterilization patterns and patient experiences vary from institution and institution? \n• Was consent obtained and how might we evaluate such consent with bioethical hindsight? \n• What happened to patients and inmates who protested sterilization? \nOur project seeks to answer these questions using a unique set of historical resources. In 2007, while pursuing \narchival research in California, Dr. Stern located 19 microfilm reels in file cabinets housed at the Department of \nMental Health (now Department of State Hospitals) in Sacramento , California. She soon discovered that these \nreels contained a treasure trove of data ---tens of thousands of sterilization recommendations from nine \ninstitutions along with supplemental letters, forms, and sterilization rosters (See Appendix A: Sample \nSterilization Recommendation Form). After receiving approval from the State of California Committee on \nHuman Subjects Protections and the University of Michigan Biomedical IRB (See Letters of Support), and pilot \nfunding from the University of Michigan, she began to collaborate with Dr. Kardia and Dr. Harlow to create a \nde-identified HIPAA-compliant data set that incorporates 212 discrete variables contained in these forms. \nThese variables include basic demographic information (Figure 1) as well as a long list of categories related to \ndiagnosis, family situation, purported evidence of criminality or sexual delinquency, just to give a few examples \n(for the full-length REDCap Data Capture Instrument see Appendix B). \nOver the past two years, the interdisciplinary team of Drs. Stern, Kardia, and Harlow has overseen the creation \nof this original dataset in Dr. Kardia's data laboratory at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. \nThis R21 would provide support for the multi-pronged data analysis phase of this project. For the first time, a \nlarge data set related to eugenic sterilization in the United States can be carefully and comprehensively \nResearch Strategy Page 39 \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nexamined through epidemiologic and historical analysis to track patterns in eugenic sterilization and recover \nthe stories of forgotten historical actors. \nS.ulc Demographic Information \nFemale Male Mlnlr.g \nIs the birth dat.e BY■ilable? \n·~1prow«¥ ... \nRace/Ethnlclty/Ancaslry \n'mu1,1provio.v-... \n,ersonal History YH \nNo \nNo \nNo lin.formaitlOn evelleblt \nWhito \nNe,gro \nCoio<od \nSpanish Sumame \nMtxkan \nChlntM \nJap11n11s.e \nlndl111n (Na:lve American) .... \nItalian \n\"\"\"' Portuguese -This project has the potential to reshape how several \nscholarly communities and the lay public understand \nthe history of eugenics and reproductive control in the \nUnited States, by demonstrating social biases \nassociated with demographic patterns of sterilization \nand by producing an interpretative mosaic of the \n,_ experiences of the thousands of people sterilized in \nCalifornia state institutions from the 1920s to the 1950s. \nAlong a similar vein, it can add a new dimension to \nunderstandings of consent in institutional settings in the \npre-bioethics era. Although consent for sterilization was \nnot legally required in California, and procedures for \nappeal not articulated until the late 1940s, \nsuperintendents at state homes and hospitals put a \ngreat deal of effort into obtaining signatures -from \nparents, spouses, or guardians -for sterilization \nrecommendat ions. Undoubtedly , this practice reflected \nIs thts a transfer patient? Otllv Wl«t ~-If tran5'« IS~ .

Nalivlty \nFigure 1. Screenshot of REDCap Data Capture \nInstrument \nEven though the majority of these sterilizations occurred over fifty years ago, their after-effects inform \napproaches to reproduction and genetics, usually by standing as a negative example. We surmise that there \nare discomfiting lessons to be learned from our historical and epidemiologic analysis with respect to attitudes \nabout people with intellectual disabilities, the worthiness of certain groups to reproduce their kind, and the \nvulnerability of institutional populations. Thus, our findings, might offer useful historical keys for assessing the \nassumptions about ability and disability that insinuate themselves into routinized and often medically valuable \nprenatal and genetics tests. Moreover , the rationale of societal burden that bolstered eugenic sterilization in the \n20th century did not disappear in the 21st century. In 2013, an investigative report revealed that approximately \n150 women in California state prisons had received unauthorized sterilizations (Johnson 2013), many from a \ncontracted physician who stated in an interview that money spent sterilizing inmates was minimal \"compared to \nwhat you save in welfare paying for these unwanted children -as they procreated more.\" (quoted in Johnson \n2013). These revelations triggered an exhaustive state audit, which determined that unauthorized procedures \nhad been performed on 144 women from 2006 to 2010, 39 of whom were sterilized \"following deficiencies in \nthe informed consent process.\" (California State Auditor 2014). They also led to the passage of a bill in the \nCalifornia legislature prohibiting sterilizations in state prisons, which Governor Jerry Brown signed in \nSeptember 2014. This project, then, might shed light on a longer history of the sterilization of vulnerable, \ninstitutionalized populations in California. \nInnovation \nThe core resource for this project, the California eugenic sterilization database , is the result of an innovative \ninterdisciplinary collaboration . This resource will permit us to elucidate patterns and track trends that hitherto \nhave been demonstrated largely through descriptive statistics or anecdotal narratives . Two studies of \nsterilization programs, in North Carolina (Schoen 2005) and Alberta, Canada (Dyck 2013), effectively use \ndescriptive statistics and basic cross-tabulation to capture overall patterns and to explore issues of consent. In \nthe case of North Carolina scholars and journalists have demonstrated that sterilization rates of African \nAmerican women rose in the 1950s and 1960s (Begos, Deaver, Railey, and Sexton 2012). For California , \nChavez-Garcia (2012) utilizes sterilization data to demonstrate that minority youth committed to juvenile \nreformatories were more likely than white youth to be sent to state hospitals for sterilization. However, to date \nno study of eugenic sterilization has employed statistical analysis to test associations between demographic \nResearch Strategy Page 40 \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \ncharacteristics and risk of sterilization. We anticipate completing the data entry of all 15,000 files in summer \n2015. Nevertheless , using data sub-sets we have been able to discern important historical patterns, particular ly \nwith regard to the comparatively high level of resistance to sterilization exhibited by Mexican-origin parents and \nfamilies (Lira and Stern 2014). We have also been able to show that Spanish-surnamed patients were \nsterilized at high rates vis-a-vis their general population in the California in three institutions . \nFor all of its strengths, our eugenic sterilization database has a glaring limitation: the reels do not include \ncomparable yearly data from un-sterilized human subjects in California state institutions or the population from \nthe hospital catchment area. In order to address this lack of control data, a key component of this R21 \nexploratory grant is to create a complementary data set of microdata (individual-level data) from the 1920, \n1930, and 1940 censuses and tract-level data from the 1950 census in order to produce a population profile of \neach institution over four decades. In each of these historic censuses, the nine state institutions under study \nwere surveyed. By reconstructing the total resident populations of these institutions, we will be able to \ndetermine identical and/or commensurate demographic variables such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, age, \nand length of commitment. We will create comparable variables by reconstructing the population \ncharacteristics for each of the hospital catchment areas. More specifically , we will take advantage of new \ntechnologies to validate public records (census rolls) digitized through crowdsourcing methods for use in \nscientific enquiry. \nOur approach incorporates methodological innovation into a project characterized by interdisciplinary \ncollaboration. In addition, this project will directly inform a companion project to create a digital archive that Dr. \nStern is developing with colleagues in the digital humanities. This archive will utilize the latest methods of data \nvisualization including a wide range of interactive graphs and charts and tell the stories of those sterilized, in \naccordance with IRB and HIPAA requirements. Using OMEKA, an open source web-publishing platform for the \ndisplay of archives and images, Dr. Stern has developed a prototype that she will expand, as a separate sister \nproject, into a \"proof of concept\" for a digital humanities submission to the National Endowment for the \nHumanities and similar funding agencies. (Prototype viewable at: californiaeugenicsarchive.omeka.net). \nApproach \nOverall Approach \nWe will create a rich statistical portrait of eugenic sterilization in California using a dataset that includes \ninformation on the 15,000 individuals recommended for eugenic sterilization between 1921 and 1952. We will \nlink this data to census records of over 100,000 residents of sterilizing institutions in the same time period in \norder to estimate population-based sterilization rates and compare risk of sterilization across institutions and \ndemographic subgroups, and over time. In addition, we will conduct qualitative analysis on the sterilization \ndataset in order to find patterns, track changes over time, and understand nuances in the historical records that \ncannot be captured using quantitative variables. \nPlanned analytical approach \nWe will use Stata 13 statistical software (StataCorp 2013) to analyze the sterilization data and correspond ing \ncensus data (see Table 1 ). We will tabulate the total number of sterilization recommendations , by year and by \ninstitution, to document longitudinal trends. We will also describe the individuals who were recommended for \nsterilization according to their gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, and diagnosis. \nWe will use microdata (individual-level data) from the 1920, 1930, and 1940 U.S. Censuses (available through \nthe Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan) to create a companion dataset that includes the \ngender, age, nativity, race, and ethnicity of all residents of sterilizing institutions during the same time period as \nthe sterilization dataset. Individual-level data from the 1950 Census are not yet available, but we will use \ncensus-tract-level data from census reports to add information on the demographic composition of institutions \nin 1950. We will also consult institutional annual and bi-annual reports for population level data. We will link this \ndata to the sterilization dataset to estimate population-based sterilization rates, with residents recommended \nfor sterilization as the numerator and total institution residents as the denominator. We will use a case-cohort \nstudy design to compare risk of sterilization across institutions, between demographic subgroups , and over \ntime. We will use Poisson regression to test whether particular demographic groups (Spanish surnamed , \nfemales, individuals under age 18, immigrants) were more likely to be sterilized than others. We will also \nevaluate this cross-tabulated data vis-a-vis aggregate state-wide and county-specific census data that \nResearch Strategy Page 41 \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \napproximates each hospital's catchment area. We hypothesize that we will find that Spanish-surnamed and \nforeign-born individuals, as well as teenagers, were disproportionately institutionalized , and that certain \ncounties had high numbers of residents committed to state institutions. We also hypothesize that associations \nbetween demograph ic variables and sterilization risk varied from institution to institution. \nTable 1.

We will draw on standardized \nlists of Spanish surnames developed by the US Census Bureau (Word and Perkins 1996) and will also \nsystematically review lists of surnames to identify Spanish surnames misspelled by census enumerators or \ninstitution staff (Gratton and Gutmann 2000). (See Appendix E: Protocol for identifying Spanish surnames) . \nPreliminary Results: Sterilization recommendations (1935-1944) and census data (1940) at Pacific \nColony \nTo demonstrate our analytic approach, we have performed sample analyses on a subset of our data from one \ninstitution , Pacific Colony, for the years 1935-1944 (the decade when sterilization reached it numeric peak). \nSterilization reccn me11clalions, \nPacific Colony 1935-1944 \nUI 250 \nS 200 o i 150 ..

As displayed in Table 2, the majority of individuals approved for sterilization (56.3%) were \nassessed as \"Morons\", a category assigned to individuals with an IQ between 51 and 70. Annual institution \nreports from Pacific Colony indicate that about 35% of all residents were classified as Morons during this time \nperiod, versus 30% Imbeciles and 20% Idiots. This suggests that Pacific Colony was more likely to \nrecommend sterilization for patients classified to have mid-level IQ versus very low levels of IQ. \nTable 3.

No \nindividuals recommended for sterilization at Pacific Colony were flagged for violent crime. \nComparison of individuals approved for sterilization to total institutionalized population \nTable 4 compares general characteristics of the individuals recommended for sterilization at Pacific Colony \nbetween 1935-1944 to the total population of individuals living at the institution in 1940. The most striking \ndifferences are by age (67% of individuals recommended for sterilization were under 18 years of age, versus \n38% of the general institution population) and by ethnicity (29% of individuals recommended for sterilization \nhad Spanish surnames , vs. only 15% of the total institution population). Thus individuals under the age of 18 \nhad 3.3 times the odds of sterilization compared to individuals age 18 or older. Individuals with Spanish \nsurnames had 2.4 times the odds of sterilization compared to individuals without Spanish surnames . We also \nobserved statistically significant differences in odds of sterilization by gender, with females having 20 percent \nhigher odds of sterilization compared to males. \nTable 4.

Using data captured via \nREDCap, we will code for patient diagnosis over time tracking the different terminology used by the institutions \nand the changing description of the patients who fit these changing diagnosis criteria. Additionally, we will \nmanually code the data from letters of protest or non-consent in order to identify trends. We will evaluate letters \nwritten by patients who opposed their own sterilization and analyze all cases in which the patient, parent, next \nof kin, or guardian refused consent. Preliminary analysis shows that non-consent often involved religious and \nfamilial objections as well as disagreement about diagnosis . We will situate these in broader historical context, \nconnecting them to histories of eugenics, reproduction, and institutionalization. We seek to achieve a balance \nbetween the statistical analysis of trends and the personal experiences of patients; to ensure that this project \ndoes not forget that each of the 15,000 people sterilized during this period in these California hospitals were \nhuman beings deserving of dignity and justice. For example, the digitized reels contain 50 handwritten letters \nproduced by inmates in Patton, a psychiatric hospital, who objected to their own sterilization and wrote \nimpassioned pleas to agency directors in Sacramento (See APPENDIX C: Sample Handwritten Protest Letter). \nThese documents beg for historical contextualization and analysis as small yet important acts of resistance \nagainst reproductive control. \nWe will carry out our multi-pronged analysis in two overlapping phases. During Year 1 we will create the \ncensus microdata set, begin to test our hypotheses , and launch coding on the qualitative data. In Year 2 we \nwill test a large set of hypotheses , advance our qualitative analysis, and disseminate our findings via \nconferences, lectures, and poster presentations, and prepare articles for submission to high-impact peer­\nreviewed public health, history, and ELSI-oriented journals. \nTimetable for Project Activities \nProject Activities \nCreation of Eugenic Steriilalion Data Set {Entry Complete by Summer 2015} \nData AnalysE> {Expand Data.

By joining historical and epidemiologic analysis, we hope \nto produce new empirical findings that will be of value to specialists and generalists interested in understanding \npast patterns and experiences of eugenic sterilization and reproduct ive control and contemplating their \nimplications for contemporary ethical, social, and legal issues in genetics, genomics , and reproductive health. \nResearch Strategy Page 44 \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nPROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS \nRisks to the subjects \nHuman subject involvement and characteristics: \nThis is a retrospect ive study using historical records without direct involvement of human subjects. The data \nset includes records of 15,000 people sterilized in California state institutions from 1921 to 1952. The data set \nwas shared with us in its complete form and we digitized it for the facility of manual data entry. \nThe individuals in the documents are aged 7 to 58 and include men, women, children, and vulnerable \npopulations, specifically those with limited mental capacity and diagnosed psychiatric disorders. The records \ninclude names, county of residence , and other identifying informatio n. Because we are using a pre-existing \ndataset that contains identifiable data, we have trained the entire data team to comply with HIPAA and patient \nconfident iality protocols. Our data capture system REDCap ensures that the master files are de-identified \nduring the coding process. Since this study will be conducted on data previously obtained for clinical purposes, \nthere is no chance of physical harm or discomfort to the subjects. \nSources of materials: The data for this study comes pre-existing historical records that have been digitized \nand are stored on a password-protected server. The original records were housed for many years at the \nDepartment of State Hospitals, and recently (with the assistance of Pl Stern) have been transferred to the \nCalifornia State Archives. The data from the records is entered into a database using the HIPAA-comp liant \nprogram REDCap. Data is managed and analyzed only by study staff, all of whom are included on the project's \nIRB and must complete appropriate PEERRS (Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research \nand Scholarship) modules. \nPotential risks: Use of this dataset will pose very minimal risk to exposing personal or confidential information. \nThe process of data extraction and input into REDCap does not involve the analysis of any identifying personal \ninformation. The data collected in this study is not of a sensitive nature. There would be no reason to believe \nthat by using the subjects' retrospective data that the subjects would be caused any harm, insults, injury to \nrelationships , loss of job or insurance , injury to their health or well-being. \nAdequacy of protection against risks \nData access and security: \nThe study team can only access the digitized sterilization authorizations on a password-protected server to \nwhich they will be granted access after completion of REDCap training, PEERRS training, and IRB inclusion. \nThey will extract and code the information from the digitized records on the server and transfer that data to the \nde-identified HI PAA-complia nt REDCap instruments . There is only one identifier field in REDCap during the \ndata entry process. Once data entry is complete, REDCap de-identifies the field so it will not be included in \ndata exports or reports. \nDigitized copies of the records are held on a password protected hard drive and locked in a safe box. All data \ncollection will take place in a locked office and on password-protected computers. No notes will be shared with \nanyone outside of the study and no information that could be used to identify an individual patient will be \ndisseminated or published . While REDCap is a web-based software, notes and data are not made available \nonline. In the unlikely event that the records are transported we will use a secure carrier only. \nPotential Benefit of the Proposed Research to the Human Subjects and Others \nThere is no potential benefit of the proposal research to human subjects and others. \nImportance of Knowledg e to be Gained \nThe analysis performed on the dataset has the potential to yield new understand ings of state-mandated \nsterilization during the eugenics era in the United States. The knowledge to be gained is historical with \npotential implications for contemporary bioethical issues related to reproduct ion and genetics. \nProtection of Human Subjects Page 45 ",

      "content": "Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi,\n\nI am config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Gerardo, your AI assistant. Below is an in-depth analysis of the NIH R21 application by Alexandra Stern, following the NIH’s Simplified Peer Review Framework. This is formatted as Agent A’s NIH grant review. After this, I can provide a vulnerability (Agent B) critique if you wish.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not provided: presumed \"Epidemiologic and Historical Analysis of Eugenic Sterilization in California\" or similar]  \n**PI:** Alexandra Stern  \n**Activity Code:** R21  \n\n---\n\n### Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)\n- **Assess Significance and Innovation:**  \n  This project seeks to create the first comprehensive, population-based epidemiologic and historical analysis of eugenic sterilization in California, analyzing 15,000 individual records (comprising 25% of known U.S. cases). It addresses pivotal questions about demographic and social biases in historic sterilization practices and links these findings to contemporary ethical, legal, and social issues in human genomics and bioethics.  \n  The dataset and companion digital archive have the potential to become important resources for multiple fields (history, public health, ELSI/bioethics, digital humanities). Methodologically, the proposed linkage to census microdata and inclusion of mixed-methods analysis is both novel and overdue.  \n- **Score (1–9):** 2  \n- **Justification:**  \n  The study confronts an acknowledged but insufficiently analyzed historic public health and social justice issue, leverages a unique dataset, and raises critical questions relevant for contemporary genomics. While retrospective, the project’s significance is enhanced by the innovation of linking to census microdata and producing a public-facing digital archive.\n\n---\n\n### Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n- **Evaluate Scientific Quality, Design Rigor, Reproducibility, Statistical Plans, Inclusion, Feasibility:**  \n  The scientific plan is well articulated, with detailed description of quantitative (case-cohort, Poisson regression, multivariable modeling) and qualitative (manual coding, thematic analysis) approaches. The pilot data demonstrate both feasibility and analytic sophistication.  \n  The plan to link institutional sterilization records to individual- and tract-level census data is methodologically rigorous and addresses a glaring gap (i.e., a control/comparator population). The inclusion of systematic protocols (e.g., for Spanish surname identification) increases rigor.  \n  Human subjects protections are addressed, relying on established HIPAA/IRB protocols for historical records. Feasibility is high: the core dataset is already digitized, and the research team has already demonstrated capability through pilot work and institutional support. There are, however, inherent limitations due to incomplete records and the inability to verify or supplement missing data.  \n- **Score (1–9):** 3  \n- **Justification:**  \n  The project is methodologically sound, feasible, and supported by pertinent pilot work. Some risk remains due to limitations in the source data and absence of non-institutionalized controls; however, the project’s design is appropriate to the aims and historical context.\n\n---\n\n### Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n- **Evaluate Investigators’ Expertise and Resource Availability:**  \n  **Sufficient**  \n  - The investigative team comprises recognized experts in history, epidemiology, and biostatistics, with access to institutional resources (University of Michigan SPH, data laboratory, IRB approval, and digital archival platforms). Infrastructure (REDCap, secure servers, digitization) for data management and analysis is well established.  \n  \n---\n\n### Additional Review Criteria  \n- **Human Subjects:** The project uses only pre-existing, historical records; data are de-identified and handled according to HIPAA/IRB standards. Risks to subjects are minimal.  \n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.  \n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.  \n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not a resubmission or renewal; not referenced.  \n  \n### Additional Considerations  \n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** REDCap software, census microdata, and digitized historical records with documented provenance and established security procedures.  \n- **Budget and Period of Support:** The budget and timeline (24 months) are appropriate for the scope; prior pilot funding and ongoing digital humanities archive development indicate strong institutional and resource support.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Impact Score (1–9)\n- **Score:** 2  \n- **Justification:**  \n  This interdisciplinary, mixed-methods project leverages a unique, large dataset to address significant historical, social, and ethical questions regarding eugenic sterilization in California. Its methodological innovation, analytic rigor, and relevance to ongoing conversations in genomics, bioethics, and social justice suggest it will have a sustained and substantial impact within and beyond its discipline. The limitations are mainly those inherent to retrospective, archival research but are appropriately mitigated by a strong research team and robust analytical design.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Adeniyi,** please let me know if you would like to see the vulnerability analysis critique (Agent B's review) or a reflection and revision based on such critique.",

      "content": "Certainly, Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi. Below is a structured NIH-style peer review of the proposal from PI Stern, following the sections and criteria you outlined. NIH scoring is on a 1 (exceptional) to 9 (poor) scale, with rationale provided for each.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Overall Impact\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The application addresses a critically important and under-examined aspect of U.S. history with direct implications for contemporary bioethics, public health, and social justice.\n- The proposal leverages a uniquely rich dataset encompassing 15,000 eugenic sterilization records, representing 25% of national cases and including a broad array of demographic and contextual variables.\n- The integration of statistical epidemiology, qualitative analysis, and digital humanities greatly enhances the potential reach and impact across disciplines.\n- The project directly addresses knowledge gaps regarding demographic patterns of sterilization, social bias, consent, and the legacy of eugenics—issues with substantial implications for present-day genomics and ethics.\n- The investigative team has completed a pilot phase demonstrating both feasibility and scholarly productivity.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The research is limited by its retrospective nature and incompleteness of archival records, which may constrain the granularity of certain analyses (e.g., missing control populations, potential selection bias in surviving records).\n- The generalizability of findings from California or institutional contexts to broader national or current bioethical issues is discussed but not methodologically addressed in depth.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Clearly articulate strategies to mitigate limitations posed by missing data, including sensitivity analyses or explicit discussion of representativeness.\n- Expand upon potential pathways for generalizing historical findings to current ELSI (ethical, legal, and social implications) debates, possibly via targeted dissemination or stakeholder engagement.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Significance\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The proposal confronts a major historic violation of reproductive rights and social justice, directly linking historical abuses to contemporary debates in genomics, disability, and health equity.\n- The PI highlights the ongoing relevance, noting the recurrence of coercive sterilization in recent decades and the legislative/policy repercussions (e.g., the 2014 CA law).\n- The digital archive promises to become a vital scholarly and public information resource, filling a significant gap in both qualitative and quantitative understandings of eugenics.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- While the narrative impact is well established, a more systematic discussion of how the historical findings may shape concrete current bioethics, law, or policy is needed.\n- The specific ways in which these data could inform modern debates about genetics, institutionalization, or reproductive rights are largely implicit.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Add explicit aims or activities to translate findings to contemporary settings (e.g., policy roundtables, stakeholder interviews, or direct dissemination to bioethics and law practitioners).\n- Discuss how lessons learned might inform ongoing practices in genetics (e.g., guidelines, safeguards).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Investigators\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The PI and team bring considerable expertise spanning history, epidemiology, biostatistics, and digital humanities, with a strong track record in eugenics scholarship and data science.\n- Prior collaboration among team members and successful pilot work support their capacity to execute the project.\n- Data management, IRB compliance, and technical proficiency (e.g., REDCap, Omeka platform) are well established.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The proposal could better detail the roles and responsibilities of each investigator, especially concerning the division of labor for qualitative analysis, statistical modeling, and digital outreach.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Provide a clearer breakdown of individual investigator contributions, including specific leaders for each aim and for the interface with the digital archive.\n- Where possible, address mentoring or training roles for junior team members.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Innovation\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The integration of a HIPAA-compliant large-scale historical dataset with census microdata is novel and addresses longstanding methodological challenges in the field.\n- The use of innovative digital tools (REDCap for data capture, Omeka for digital archiving, interactive data visualizations) expands audience reach and methodological breadth.\n- The systematic identification of Spanish surnames and coding protocols demonstrates methodological creativity and rigor.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The innovation section could more explicitly discuss novel aspects relative to existing research, including how this approach surpasses prior descriptive or anecdotal studies.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Emphasize comparative advantages over previous work in the field—specifically, statistical power, granularity of data, or new linkage methods.\n- Consider expanding on how the digital archive will support reproducibility, public engagement, or future research.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Approach\n\n**SCORE:** 3\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The analytic plan is rigorous, leveraging both quantitative (regression, case-cohort, risk modeling) and qualitative (systematic coding, thematic trends) methodologies.\n- The pilot study data convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of both data capture and analysis.\n- The plan includes clear milestones, a project timeline, and robust measures for data protection and confidentiality.\n- Explicit protocols for Spanish surname identification, variable linkage, and consent/context analyses strengthen methodological fidelity.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The lack of non-institutionalized control data is acknowledged and addressed via census microdata but may still restrict causal inference.\n- Details on management and reconciliation of missing or incomplete data are limited.\n- More details could be provided about qualitative data analysis methods (coding frameworks, inter-rater reliability, integration with quantitative results).\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Strengthen methodology for addressing missing and incomplete data, possibly including imputation, subgroup sensitivity analyses, or explicit limitations in result interpretation.\n- Clarify the qualitative analytic framework and describe how qualitative and quantitative results will be integrated.\n- Where possible, consider external advisory input on analytic plans.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Environment\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The University of Michigan School of Public Health provides ample resources, technical infrastructure, and IRB oversight for the project.\n- Data management systems (REDCap, secure servers, physical controls) are robust.\n- Institutional support for digital archival (ongoing pilot work, digital humanities expertise) further enhances project environment.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The application could comment further on linkages with broader university or national networks (e.g., access to census expertise, bioethics centers, outreach programs) that might enhance potential impact.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Highlight collaborations or partnerships—current or pending—with other relevant centers, archives, or community organizations.\n- Discuss plans for long-term data preservation and access for future researchers or the public.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Assessment\n\nThis is a highly meritorious, unusually innovative, and methodologically robust proposal targeting a critical but understudied facet of U.S. public health and bioethical history. The strengths include a unique dataset, rigorous analytic planning, a skillful investigative team, and a potential for substantial scholarly and social impact across disciplines. The weaknesses are largely inherent to retrospective research—e.g., incomplete records, limit on causal inference—but are generally well addressed by the proposed methods. A few areas, such as generalizability, integration of historical insights into contemporary discourse, and details on certain analytic techniques, should be refined to maximize potential and clarity. With modest revision, this work is poised to exert a sustained, transformative influence on eugenics scholarship and its ethical-legislative legacy.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Strengthen plans for handling missing and incomplete data.  \n- Make more explicit connections and dissemination strategies to inform current policy, ethics, and public health audiences.  \n- Provide greater clarity on analytic team responsibilities and qualitative data methods.  \n- Highlight external collaborations and long-term sustainability plans for the digital archive.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you would like elaboration or expanded recommendations on any section, Dr. Adeniyi.",

Working with a dataset that contains 15,000 \nof these records from the period 1921 to 1952, and that comprises 25% of recorded eugenic sterilizations in \nthe United States, we seek to show the relevance of our historical findings to contemporary ethical, legal, and \nsocial issues in human genomics. Thousands of those sterilized under eugenic laws were deemed \"unfit\" \nbased on I.Q. scores and psychiatric classifications , or as delinquent due to their sexual behavior or petty \ncriminal records. While today reproductive autonomy is a cherished bioethical precept and a largely protected \nlegal right, we can learn a great deal from closely studying an era in which a particular variant of genetic \ndeterminism resulted in the state-mandated deprivation of reproductive capacity. \nOur specific aims are: \n1. To conduct extensive quantitative analysis using the eugenic sterilization dataset we have created during \nthe pilot phase of this project. This de-identified HIPAA-compliant dataset was created using REDCap and \nincludes 212 discrete variables for each of the 15,000 records. Using this wealth of coded data, we intend \nto describe patterns of sterilization according to gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, and diagnosis, as well \nas contextual factors such as patient's institution, medical superintendent , and family structure. \n2. To link the eugenic sterilization dataset to individual-level census microdata and tract-level census reports \nto permit population-based estimates of sterilization rates. By linking the two datasets we will be able to \ntest the associations of gender, age, ethnicity, nationality , diagnosis and other variables with the risk of \nsterilization . For example, we hypothesize that Spanish-surnamed patients and young teenagers were \ndisproportionately sterilized. Preliminary data analysis confirms this hypothesis for one institution , and we \nwish to test this hypothesis and a larger set of hypotheses related to social bias in and across institutions . \n3. To conduct qualitative analysis with the sterilization records, supplemental files, charts, and forms in the \ndigitized microfilm reels. Once our eugenic sterilization dataset is completed in summer 2015, we will be \nable perform keyword searches to identify themes, such as familial resistance to sterilization or patient \nrefusals, and to trace terminology trends over time. In addition, we will explore the meaning and limits of \nconsent in a context where sterilization was the precondition for institutional release. \n4. To incorporate our findings into a companion digital archive that features data visualization , historical \ninterpretation , and patient stories; this is under parallel development with digital humanities colleagues. \nWe will devote 24 months to quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dataset of 15,000 sterilization \nrecommendations (approximately 30,000 individual documents) that we have built with an internal pilot grant. \nWe will link the sterilization data to census microdata (individual-level data) constructed from the 1920, 1930, \nand 1940 censuses and tract-level data from the 1950 census, which will enable us to understand discrete and \nlongitudinal patterns of sterilization in and across state institutions. This rich data source provides a unique \nopportunity to conduct an empirical analysis of the practice of eugenics in the United States coupled with an \ninformative textual analysis of state-institutional practices. The companion digital archive will create an \nimportant historical resource for future researchers. \nDuring Year 1, we will create the census microdata set for all nine institutions under study; produce descriptive \nstatistics according to gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, diagnosis, and other variables; and conduct \npopulation-based quantitative analyses. In addition, we will undertake coding of the documents for the \nqualitative analysis of keywords and trends. We will submit abstracts to present our findings at public health, \nhistory, ethics, and ELSI community conferences , and begin to draft and outline peer-review articles. \nDuring Year 2 we will test hypotheses about increased risk of sterilization among particular subgroups by \ncombining the eugenic sterilization data set and the census microdata set. We will conduct our qualitative \nanalyses to analyze familial and patient objections to sterilization and to examine the limits of consent process \nin an institutional setting. We will prepare articles for peer review in scholarly journals and disseminate findings \nto history, public health, and ELSI communities . Relevant findings will inform a companion digital history \narchive under parallel development and for which we will apply for funding from humanities and history \nprograms. We will prepare articles for peer review in scholarly journals and continue to disseminate findings to \nhistory, public health, and ELSI communities . \nSpecific Aims Page 38 \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nRESEARCH STRATEGY \nSignificance \nDuring much of the twentieth century, eugenics was a popular \"science\" in much of the world (Bashford and \nLevine 2010). In its \"positive\" or softer form, eugenics manifested in activities such as better babies contests, \ninfant welfare programs , or pronatalist programs directed at groups deemed superior (Schneider 1990; Stepan \n1996; Kline 2001 ). In its more negative form, eugenics involved heavy-handed forms of reproductive control \nsuch as sterilization or mass euthanasia (Proctor 1988; Weindling 1989; Lombardo 2010; Black 2012; Hansen \nand King 2013). Genetic determinism undergirded both \"positive\" and \"negative\" eugenics although the former \nallowed greater latitude for environmental factors. From the 1900s through the 1960s, both variants of \neugenics influenced policies and attitudes on local and national levels in the United States (Paul 1995; Kevles \n1995; Largent 2008; Lombardo 2011 ). \nIndeed, many people are surprised to learn that in 1907 the Midwestern state of Indiana passed the world's \nfirst sterilization law, which authorized medical superintendents in homes and hospitals to sterilize people \nwhose deleterious heredity appeared to threaten society (Stern 2007). From this first law in 1907 to 1937, 32 \nU.S. states passed eugenic sterilization laws, which were used to control the reproduction of vulnerable \npopulations until the 1970s, when legislatures started to repeal these statutes. Over the period of about six \ndecades, over 60,000 sterilizations were officially recorded, principally in state homes and hospitals for the \nfeebleminded and mentally ill. Sterilization rates were fairly steady in the 191 Os and 1920s as eugenics gained \ncurrency, and increased markedly after 1927 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutiona lity of the \nprocedure in Buck v. Bell, a case that tested Virginia's 1924 law (Lombardo 2010). California passed the third \nlaw in the nation in 1909 and performed 1/3, or 20,000 of all documented sterilizations , the vast majority of \nthese between the 1920s and 1950s (Braslow 1997; Kline 2001; Stern 2005; Wellerstein 2011 ). \nThe broad contours of eugenic sterilization and coercive eugenics in the United States are familiar to many \nhistorians, geneticists, and bioethicists (Kelves and Hood 1993; Paul 1998; Buchanan et al. 2001; Andrews \n2002; Duster 2003; Mehlman 2009; McCabe and McCabe 2010; Comfort 2012) and it is not uncommon for \neugenic sterilization to be held up as an egregious example of early \"pseudoscientific \" human genetics. \nHowever, few empirical historical analyses of this practice are available. \n• Who was sterilized? \n• Were some groups disproport ionately sterilized? \n• Did racial or ethnic bias affect sterilization decisions and patterns? \n• Were age, gender, diagnosis, and nationality associated with a higher risk of sterilization? \n• How did sterilization practices and patterns change over time? \n• How did sterilization patterns and patient experiences vary from institution and institution? \n• Was consent obtained and how might we evaluate such consent with bioethical hindsight? \n• What happened to patients and inmates who protested sterilization? \nOur project seeks to answer these questions using a unique set of historical resources. In 2007, while pursuing \narchival research in California, Dr. Stern located 19 microfilm reels in file cabinets housed at the Department of \nMental Health (now Department of State Hospitals) in Sacramento , California. She soon discovered that these \nreels contained a treasure trove of data ---tens of thousands of sterilization recommendations from nine \ninstitutions along with supplemental letters, forms, and sterilization rosters (See Appendix A: Sample \nSterilization Recommendation Form). After receiving approval from the State of California Committee on \nHuman Subjects Protections and the University of Michigan Biomedical IRB (See Letters of Support), and pilot \nfunding from the University of Michigan, she began to collaborate with Dr. Kardia and Dr. Harlow to create a \nde-identified HIPAA-compliant data set that incorporates 212 discrete variables contained in these forms. \nThese variables include basic demographic information (Figure 1) as well as a long list of categories related to \ndiagnosis, family situation, purported evidence of criminality or sexual delinquency, just to give a few examples \n(for the full-length REDCap Data Capture Instrument see Appendix B). \nOver the past two years, the interdisciplinary team of Drs. Stern, Kardia, and Harlow has overseen the creation \nof this original dataset in Dr. Kardia's data laboratory at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. \nThis R21 would provide support for the multi-pronged data analysis phase of this project. For the first time, a \nlarge data set related to eugenic sterilization in the United States can be carefully and comprehensively \nResearch Strategy Page 39 \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nexamined through epidemiologic and historical analysis to track patterns in eugenic sterilization and recover \nthe stories of forgotten historical actors. \nS.ulc Demographic Information \nFemale Male Mlnlr.g \nIs the birth dat.e BY■ilable? \n·~1prow«¥ ... \nRace/Ethnlclty/Ancaslry \n'mu1,1provio.v-... \n,ersonal History YH \nNo \nNo \nNo lin.formaitlOn evelleblt \nWhito \nNe,gro \nCoio<od \nSpanish Sumame \nMtxkan \nChlntM \nJap11n11s.e \nlndl111n (Na:lve American) .... \nItalian \n\"\"\"' Portuguese -This project has the potential to reshape how several \nscholarly communities and the lay public understand \nthe history of eugenics and reproductive control in the \nUnited States, by demonstrating social biases \nassociated with demographic patterns of sterilization \nand by producing an interpretative mosaic of the \n,_ experiences of the thousands of people sterilized in \nCalifornia state institutions from the 1920s to the 1950s. \nAlong a similar vein, it can add a new dimension to \nunderstandings of consent in institutional settings in the \npre-bioethics era.

Screenshot of REDCap Data Capture \nInstrument \nEven though the majority of these sterilizations occurred over fifty years ago, their after-effects inform \napproaches to reproduction and genetics, usually by standing as a negative example. We surmise that there \nare discomfiting lessons to be learned from our historical and epidemiologic analysis with respect to attitudes \nabout people with intellectual disabilities, the worthiness of certain groups to reproduce their kind, and the \nvulnerability of institutional populations. Thus, our findings, might offer useful historical keys for assessing the \nassumptions about ability and disability that insinuate themselves into routinized and often medically valuable \nprenatal and genetics tests. Moreover , the rationale of societal burden that bolstered eugenic sterilization in the \n20th century did not disappear in the 21st century. In 2013, an investigative report revealed that approximately \n150 women in California state prisons had received unauthorized sterilizations (Johnson 2013), many from a \ncontracted physician who stated in an interview that money spent sterilizing inmates was minimal \"compared to \nwhat you save in welfare paying for these unwanted children -as they procreated more.\" (quoted in Johnson \n2013). These revelations triggered an exhaustive state audit, which determined that unauthorized procedures \nhad been performed on 144 women from 2006 to 2010, 39 of whom were sterilized \"following deficiencies in \nthe informed consent process.\" (California State Auditor 2014). They also led to the passage of a bill in the \nCalifornia legislature prohibiting sterilizations in state prisons, which Governor Jerry Brown signed in \nSeptember 2014. This project, then, might shed light on a longer history of the sterilization of vulnerable, \ninstitutionalized populations in California. \nInnovation \nThe core resource for this project, the California eugenic sterilization database , is the result of an innovative \ninterdisciplinary collaboration . This resource will permit us to elucidate patterns and track trends that hitherto \nhave been demonstrated largely through descriptive statistics or anecdotal narratives . Two studies of \nsterilization programs, in North Carolina (Schoen 2005) and Alberta, Canada (Dyck 2013), effectively use \ndescriptive statistics and basic cross-tabulation to capture overall patterns and to explore issues of consent. In \nthe case of North Carolina scholars and journalists have demonstrated that sterilization rates of African \nAmerican women rose in the 1950s and 1960s (Begos, Deaver, Railey, and Sexton 2012). For California , \nChavez-Garcia (2012) utilizes sterilization data to demonstrate that minority youth committed to juvenile \nreformatories were more likely than white youth to be sent to state hospitals for sterilization. However, to date \nno study of eugenic sterilization has employed statistical analysis to test associations between demographic \nResearch Strategy Page 40 \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \ncharacteristics and risk of sterilization. We anticipate completing the data entry of all 15,000 files in summer \n2015. Nevertheless , using data sub-sets we have been able to discern important historical patterns, particular ly \nwith regard to the comparatively high level of resistance to sterilization exhibited by Mexican-origin parents and \nfamilies (Lira and Stern 2014). We have also been able to show that Spanish-surnamed patients were \nsterilized at high rates vis-a-vis their general population in the California in three institutions . \nFor all of its strengths, our eugenic sterilization database has a glaring limitation: the reels do not include \ncomparable yearly data from un-sterilized human subjects in California state institutions or the population from \nthe hospital catchment area. In order to address this lack of control data, a key component of this R21 \nexploratory grant is to create a complementary data set of microdata (individual-level data) from the 1920, \n1930, and 1940 censuses and tract-level data from the 1950 census in order to produce a population profile of \neach institution over four decades. In each of these historic censuses, the nine state institutions under study \nwere surveyed. By reconstructing the total resident populations of these institutions, we will be able to \ndetermine identical and/or commensurate demographic variables such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, age, \nand length of commitment. We will create comparable variables by reconstructing the population \ncharacteristics for each of the hospital catchment areas. More specifically , we will take advantage of new \ntechnologies to validate public records (census rolls) digitized through crowdsourcing methods for use in \nscientific enquiry. \nOur approach incorporates methodological innovation into a project characterized by interdisciplinary \ncollaboration. In addition, this project will directly inform a companion project to create a digital archive that Dr. \nStern is developing with colleagues in the digital humanities. This archive will utilize the latest methods of data \nvisualization including a wide range of interactive graphs and charts and tell the stories of those sterilized, in \naccordance with IRB and HIPAA requirements. Using OMEKA, an open source web-publishing platform for the \ndisplay of archives and images, Dr. Stern has developed a prototype that she will expand, as a separate sister \nproject, into a \"proof of concept\" for a digital humanities submission to the National Endowment for the \nHumanities and similar funding agencies. (Prototype viewable at: californiaeugenicsarchive.omeka.net). \nApproach \nOverall Approach \nWe will create a rich statistical portrait of eugenic sterilization in California using a dataset that includes \ninformation on the 15,000 individuals recommended for eugenic sterilization between 1921 and 1952. We will \nlink this data to census records of over 100,000 residents of sterilizing institutions in the same time period in \norder to estimate population-based sterilization rates and compare risk of sterilization across institutions and \ndemographic subgroups, and over time. In addition, we will conduct qualitative analysis on the sterilization \ndataset in order to find patterns, track changes over time, and understand nuances in the historical records that \ncannot be captured using quantitative variables. \nPlanned analytical approach \nWe will use Stata 13 statistical software (StataCorp 2013) to analyze the sterilization data and correspond ing \ncensus data (see Table 1 ). We will tabulate the total number of sterilization recommendations , by year and by \ninstitution, to document longitudinal trends. We will also describe the individuals who were recommended for \nsterilization according to their gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, and diagnosis. \nWe will use microdata (individual-level data) from the 1920, 1930, and 1940 U.S. Censuses (available through \nthe Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan) to create a companion dataset that includes the \ngender, age, nativity, race, and ethnicity of all residents of sterilizing institutions during the same time period as \nthe sterilization dataset. Individual-level data from the 1950 Census are not yet available, but we will use \ncensus-tract-level data from census reports to add information on the demographic composition of institutions \nin 1950. We will also consult institutional annual and bi-annual reports for population level data. We will link this \ndata to the sterilization dataset to estimate population-based sterilization rates, with residents recommended \nfor sterilization as the numerator and total institution residents as the denominator. We will use a case-cohort \nstudy design to compare risk of sterilization across institutions, between demographic subgroups , and over \ntime. We will use Poisson regression to test whether particular demographic groups (Spanish surnamed , \nfemales, individuals under age 18, immigrants) were more likely to be sterilized than others. We will also \nevaluate this cross-tabulated data vis-a-vis aggregate state-wide and county-specific census data that \nResearch Strategy Page 41 \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \napproximates each hospital's catchment area. We hypothesize that we will find that Spanish-surnamed and \nforeign-born individuals, as well as teenagers, were disproportionately institutionalized , and that certain \ncounties had high numbers of residents committed to state institutions. We also hypothesize that associations \nbetween demograph ic variables and sterilization risk varied from institution to institution. \nTable 1.

We will draw on standardized \nlists of Spanish surnames developed by the US Census Bureau (Word and Perkins 1996) and will also \nsystematically review lists of surnames to identify Spanish surnames misspelled by census enumerators or \ninstitution staff (Gratton and Gutmann 2000). (See Appendix E: Protocol for identifying Spanish surnames) . \nPreliminary Results: Sterilization recommendations (1935-1944) and census data (1940) at Pacific \nColony \nTo demonstrate our analytic approach, we have performed sample analyses on a subset of our data from one \ninstitution , Pacific Colony, for the years 1935-1944 (the decade when sterilization reached it numeric peak). \nSterilization reccn me11clalions, \nPacific Colony 1935-1944 \nUI 250 \nS 200 o i 150 ..

As displayed in Table 2, the majority of individuals approved for sterilization (56.3%) were \nassessed as \"Morons\", a category assigned to individuals with an IQ between 51 and 70. Annual institution \nreports from Pacific Colony indicate that about 35% of all residents were classified as Morons during this time \nperiod, versus 30% Imbeciles and 20% Idiots. This suggests that Pacific Colony was more likely to \nrecommend sterilization for patients classified to have mid-level IQ versus very low levels of IQ. \nTable 3. Other signs of \"bad heredity\" , by Spanish \nsurname, among Pacific Colony residents \nrecommended for sterilization 1935-1944 (n=1003) \nSpanish Non-Spanish \nsurname surname \n\"Sexual delinquency\" 33.8% 22.0% \nPetty crime 15.0% 7.5% \nViolent crime 0% 0% Table 3 displays the proportion of individuals \nrecommended for sterilization who were judged to \nhave other signs of \"bad heredity\" that could justify \nsterilization: sexual delinquency and criminality. \nIndividuals with Spanish surnames were more \nlikely to be termed \"sexually delinquent\" compared \nto individuals without Spanish surnames (34% vs. \n22%), and twice as likely to have been flagged for \npetty crime such as theft (15% vs. 7.5%). No \nindividuals recommended for sterilization at Pacific Colony were flagged for violent crime. \nComparison of individuals approved for sterilization to total institutionalized population \nTable 4 compares general characteristics of the individuals recommended for sterilization at Pacific Colony \nbetween 1935-1944 to the total population of individuals living at the institution in 1940. The most striking \ndifferences are by age (67% of individuals recommended for sterilization were under 18 years of age, versus \n38% of the general institution population) and by ethnicity (29% of individuals recommended for sterilization \nhad Spanish surnames , vs. only 15% of the total institution population). Thus individuals under the age of 18 \nhad 3.3 times the odds of sterilization compared to individuals age 18 or older. Individuals with Spanish \nsurnames had 2.4 times the odds of sterilization compared to individuals without Spanish surnames . We also \nobserved statistically significant differences in odds of sterilization by gender, with females having 20 percent \nhigher odds of sterilization compared to males. \nTable 4.

Using data captured via \nREDCap, we will code for patient diagnosis over time tracking the different terminology used by the institutions \nand the changing description of the patients who fit these changing diagnosis criteria. Additionally, we will \nmanually code the data from letters of protest or non-consent in order to identify trends. We will evaluate letters \nwritten by patients who opposed their own sterilization and analyze all cases in which the patient, parent, next \nof kin, or guardian refused consent. Preliminary analysis shows that non-consent often involved religious and \nfamilial objections as well as disagreement about diagnosis . We will situate these in broader historical context, \nconnecting them to histories of eugenics, reproduction, and institutionalization. We seek to achieve a balance \nbetween the statistical analysis of trends and the personal experiences of patients; to ensure that this project \ndoes not forget that each of the 15,000 people sterilized during this period in these California hospitals were \nhuman beings deserving of dignity and justice. For example, the digitized reels contain 50 handwritten letters \nproduced by inmates in Patton, a psychiatric hospital, who objected to their own sterilization and wrote \nimpassioned pleas to agency directors in Sacramento (See APPENDIX C: Sample Handwritten Protest Letter). \nThese documents beg for historical contextualization and analysis as small yet important acts of resistance \nagainst reproductive control. \nWe will carry out our multi-pronged analysis in two overlapping phases. During Year 1 we will create the \ncensus microdata set, begin to test our hypotheses , and launch coding on the qualitative data. In Year 2 we \nwill test a large set of hypotheses , advance our qualitative analysis, and disseminate our findings via \nconferences, lectures, and poster presentations, and prepare articles for submission to high-impact peer­\nreviewed public health, history, and ELSI-oriented journals. \nTimetable for Project Activities \nProject Activities \nCreation of Eugenic Steriilalion Data Set {Entry Complete by Summer 2015} \nData AnalysE> {Expand Data.

It also proposes methodological \ninnovation, as we link the eugenic sterilization database to census microdata to order to conduct a population­\nbased analysis that to date has not been attempted. By joining historical and epidemiologic analysis, we hope \nto produce new empirical findings that will be of value to specialists and generalists interested in understanding \npast patterns and experiences of eugenic sterilization and reproduct ive control and contemplating their \nimplications for contemporary ethical, social, and legal issues in genetics, genomics , and reproductive health. \nResearch Strategy Page 44 \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nPROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS \nRisks to the subjects \nHuman subject involvement and characteristics: \nThis is a retrospect ive study using historical records without direct involvement of human subjects. The data \nset includes records of 15,000 people sterilized in California state institutions from 1921 to 1952. The data set \nwas shared with us in its complete form and we digitized it for the facility of manual data entry. \nThe individuals in the documents are aged 7 to 58 and include men, women, children, and vulnerable \npopulations, specifically those with limited mental capacity and diagnosed psychiatric disorders. The records \ninclude names, county of residence , and other identifying informatio n. Because we are using a pre-existing \ndataset that contains identifiable data, we have trained the entire data team to comply with HIPAA and patient \nconfident iality protocols. Our data capture system REDCap ensures that the master files are de-identified \nduring the coding process. Since this study will be conducted on data previously obtained for clinical purposes, \nthere is no chance of physical harm or discomfort to the subjects. \nSources of materials: The data for this study comes pre-existing historical records that have been digitized \nand are stored on a password-protected server. The original records were housed for many years at the \nDepartment of State Hospitals, and recently (with the assistance of Pl Stern) have been transferred to the \nCalifornia State Archives. The data from the records is entered into a database using the HIPAA-comp liant \nprogram REDCap. Data is managed and analyzed only by study staff, all of whom are included on the project's \nIRB and must complete appropriate PEERRS (Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research \nand Scholarship) modules. \nPotential risks: Use of this dataset will pose very minimal risk to exposing personal or confidential information. \nThe process of data extraction and input into REDCap does not involve the analysis of any identifying personal \ninformation. The data collected in this study is not of a sensitive nature. There would be no reason to believe \nthat by using the subjects' retrospective data that the subjects would be caused any harm, insults, injury to \nrelationships , loss of job or insurance , injury to their health or well-being. \nAdequacy of protection against risks \nData access and security: \nThe study team can only access the digitized sterilization authorizations on a password-protected server to \nwhich they will be granted access after completion of REDCap training, PEERRS training, and IRB inclusion. \nThey will extract and code the information from the digitized records on the server and transfer that data to the \nde-identified HI PAA-complia nt REDCap instruments . There is only one identifier field in REDCap during the \ndata entry process. Once data entry is complete, REDCap de-identifies the field so it will not be included in \ndata exports or reports. \nDigitized copies of the records are held on a password protected hard drive and locked in a safe box. All data \ncollection will take place in a locked office and on password-protected computers. No notes will be shared with \nanyone outside of the study and no information that could be used to identify an individual patient will be \ndisseminated or published . While REDCap is a web-based software, notes and data are not made available \nonline. In the unlikely event that the records are transported we will use a secure carrier only. \nPotential Benefit of the Proposed Research to the Human Subjects and Others \nThere is no potential benefit of the proposal research to human subjects and others. \nImportance of Knowledg e to be Gained \nThe analysis performed on the dataset has the potential to yield new understand ings of state-mandated \nsterilization during the eugenics era in the United States. The knowledge to be gained is historical with \npotential implications for contemporary bioethical issues related to reproduct ion and genetics. \nProtection of Human Subjects Page 45 ",

Overall Impact\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The project leverages a highly unique, large, de-identified historical dataset comprising approximately 15,000 records, representing a significant proportion of all eugenic sterilizations in the U.S.\n- The work directly addresses substantial and ongoing ethical, legal, and social issues in human genomics, highlighting the intersection of historical eugenics and modern reproductive autonomy.\n- Strong interdisciplinary approach, integrating epidemiologic, statistical, qualitative, and digital humanities methodologies; proposal to build a digital archive greatly expands reach and future utility.\n- Robust preliminary work including dataset creation, pilot analysis, and IRB compliance demonstrates both feasibility and commitment by PI and team.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Retrospective nature limits the ability to draw causal inferences; unavoidable gaps and possible biases in the original records may restrict conclusions.\n- While proposing contemporary relevance, the pathway for translating historical insights into policy or practice is not fully articulated.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Articulate a more explicit knowledge translation or policy engagement plan (e.g., target presentations to policymakers, collaborations with bioethicists or advocacy organizations).\n- Consider including sensitivity analyses or methodological caveats in published outputs to address potential biases and data limitations.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Significance\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Fills a compelling gap in both historical and public health scholarship about the empirical scope and demographic patterns of eugenic sterilization, particularly in California.\n- Directly engages contemporary issues around reproductive rights, disability, and institutionalization, providing a historical lens for current debates.\n- The creation of a digital companion archive and public dissemination plans are likely to have both scholarly and societal impact.\n- The findings have potential implications for understanding ongoing reproductive injustices, as illustrated by the recent exposure of unauthorized sterilizations in CA prisons.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The correlation between historical findings and broader modern-day practice, legislation, or bioethical understanding is implied rather than mapped in concrete terms.\n- Discussion of how this work will inform or reach relevant stakeholders outside of academia remains underdeveloped.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Add explicit, actionable objectives for the dissemination of key findings to stakeholder groups (e.g., legal, policy, advocacy, or medical communities).\n- Develop an outreach strategy for community engagement, especially with groups historically impacted or presently at risk.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Investigators\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- PI Stern and her team are highly qualified, with backgrounds in history, epidemiology, and biostatistics, and experience with large administrative datasets and digital archives.\n- Effective interdisciplinary collaboration is demonstrated—pilot phase completed, IRB standards met, data systems in place, and relationships established with key institutions.\n- Clearly valiant effort by the PI to build and maintain the dataset and secure IRB/HIPAA compliance.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- While the team’s credentials are strong, delineated roles/responsibilities for each phase of work could be described in greater detail to further inspire reviewer confidence.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Provide a more granular description of team structure, specifying leadership and primary responsibility for each key analytic and dissemination task.\n- Include a brief statement regarding plans for mentorship or capacity building for junior scholars or digital archivists involved.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Innovation\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The proposal is exceptionally innovative in its integration of a novel, HIPAA-compliant historical dataset with census microdata for sophisticated epidemiological inquiry.\n- The digital archive component, with data visualization and user interactivity, brings the project to the forefront of digital humanities and public scholarship.\n- Methodological advances include systematic surname identification protocols and robust linkage between disparate historical sources.\n- The mixed-methods approach, especially the combination of statistical and qualitative archival analysis, is a model for historical-epidemiological studies.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The innovation section could be enhanced by explicitly detailing how digital and methodological strategies will be made scalable or transferable to other datasets or domains.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Discuss plans for open-source sharing of code, digital workflows, or methodological frameworks to facilitate broader adoption of these innovative approaches.\n- Explicitly outline how methodological advances could serve as models or test cases for other domains in public health data science or digital history.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Approach\n\n**SCORE:** 3\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analytic plan, including specific attention to population-based rates via linkage with census microdata.\n- Developing protocols for rigorous identification and classification of ethnicity, diagnosis, and demographic/patient characteristics.\n- Statistical and qualitative pilot analyses provide strong proof of concept.\n- Plan includes robust human subjects protection measures and clear timeline/milestones.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some gaps in detail regarding the handling of missing/confounded data and potential biases due to record incompleteness or selection.\n- The proposal could better describe procedures for integrating qualitative with quantitative findings and mechanisms for ensuring rigor (e.g., inter-rater reliability) in qualitative coding.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Expand detail on management of incomplete or inconsistent data, including data cleaning, missingness analysis, and impact on inference.\n- Clarify and strengthen discussion of qualitative coding frameworks (e.g., codebook development, training, and cross-checking), and explain how qualitative and quantitative strands will be merged analytically.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Environment\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The University of Michigan provides a rich academic and technical environment, with robust infrastructure for data management, IRB oversight, and digital humanities collaboration.\n- Ready access to census data, secure servers, and REDCap software are all clear assets.\n- Preliminary funding and support, together with prior success of the pilot project, reinforce the stability and adequacy of the environment.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Potential for greater collaboration with external archives, public health institutions, or advocacy organizations is noted but not fully developed.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Seek or detail additional partnerships with relevant national archives, advocacy groups, or transdisciplinary research centers to increase project scope, reach, and sustainability.\n- Delineate long-term strategies for data and archive maintenance, user support, and public accessibility after the project concludes.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Assessment\n\nThis well-conceived, highly innovative project leverages a unique resource to address a profound historical and contemporary gap in understanding the practice and legacy of eugenics in California. The strengths of the proposal are in its dataset, personnel, innovative analytic and digital strategy, and significance to multiple fields and public discourse. Areas for improvement center on the articulation of plans to mitigate data limitations, more detailed procedures for mixed-methods rigor, and expanded engagement with stakeholders and collaborators for maximal impact and long-term sustainability. With minor revisions, the project is positioned to make major scholarly and societal contributions.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Enhance methodological rigor via clear data cleaning, integration, and reliability procedures.  \n- More explicitly develop outreach and stakeholder engagement components.  \n- Plan for open-source and sustainability strategies for digital outputs.  \n- Articulate team structure and mentorship more fully to underscore capability.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like any elaboration, focused suggestions, or specific language for summary statements, Dr. Adeniyi.",

Please reflect on this feedback and regenerate your response, addressing the valid concerns while explaining why you might disagree with any points you find incorrect:\n\nDr. Ezekiel Adeniyi,\n\nI am config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Claudius, AI assistant. Below is my critical analysis of the grant review provided by config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Gerardo.\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Factor 1: Importance of the Research (Score should be 1-9)\n**Critical Issues:**\n- Agent A provided a score of 2 for \"Overall Impact\" but failed to provide distinct scores for Factor 1 (Importance) as required by the Simplified Peer Review Framework\n- The review conflates \"Significance\" (scored as 2) with Factor 1, but significance is only one component alongside innovation\n- Innovation is scored separately as 1, creating confusion about how these relate to Factor 1\n- No integrated assessment of how significance and innovation together determine the importance score\n\n### Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (Score should be 1-9)\n**Critical Issues:**\n- No Factor 2 score provided at all\n- \"Approach\" is scored as 3, but this doesn't map cleanly to Factor 2's requirements\n- Missing explicit evaluation of:\n  - Statistical plans adequacy\n  - Reproducibility measures\n  - Human subjects protections (mentioned but not evaluated under this factor)\n  - Inclusion diversity considerations\n- The feasibility assessment is scattered across sections rather than consolidated\n\n### Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient/Insufficient rating)\n**Critical Issues:**\n- Agent A provides numerical scores (Investigators: 2, Environment: 2) instead of the required \"Sufficient/Insufficient\" determination\n- The framework explicitly states Factor 3 should not receive a numerical score\n- No integrated assessment combining investigator expertise with institutional resources\n\n### Additional Review Criteria\n**Missing Elements:**\n- Human Subjects section mentioned in passing but not properly addressed as a distinct criterion\n- Vertebrate Animals: Not addressed (though likely N/A)\n- Biohazards: Not addressed (though likely N/A)\n- Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions: Not addressed\n\n### Additional Considerations\n**Completely Missing:**\n- Authentication of Key Resources\n- Budget and Period of Support\n\n### Overall Impact Score\n**Issues:**\n- Score of 2 provided, but justification doesn't clearly integrate all three factors\n- The review structure (using traditional NIH criteria like Significance, Innovation, etc.) doesn't align with the requested Simplified Framework format\n\n### Structural and Compliance Problems\n\n1. **Framework Misalignment**: The entire review follows the traditional NIH review criteria (Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, Environment) rather than the specified Simplified Peer Review Framework with its three factors\n\n2. **Scoring Confusion**: Numerical scores are provided where they shouldn't be (Factor 3) and missing where required (Factors 1 and 2)\n\n3. **Missing Required Sections**: Multiple required sections are entirely absent from the review\n\n4. **Format Non-compliance**: The review doesn't follow the requested template structure at all\n\n### Summary\n\nThis review fundamentally fails to follow the Simplified Peer Review Framework instructions. Agent A appears to have defaulted to traditional NIH review criteria rather than the specified three-factor framework. This results in:\n- Incorrect scoring methodology\n- Missing required assessments\n- Structural non-compliance with the requested format\n- Incomplete evaluation of required criteria\n\nThe content itself shows thoughtful analysis of the grant's merits and weaknesses, but it's delivered in the wrong framework entirely. A complete restructuring would be needed to meet the specified requirements, including:\n1. Proper Factor 1 and 2 numerical scores (1-9)\n2. Factor 3 as Sufficient/Insufficient determination\n3. All additional review criteria addressed\n4. All additional considerations included\n5. Adherence to the specified template format\n\nThe review would need to be completely rewritten to comply with the Simplified Peer Review Framework rather than revised incrementally.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi, for supplying config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Claudius’s detailed critique. I appreciate the rigorous assessment and agree that my prior review followed the traditional NIH five-criteria framework, rather than the explicitly requested Simplified Peer Review Framework. Below, I reflect on each point, explain my stance, and then provide a fully revised, compliant review using the required template.\n\n---\n\n### Reflection on Key Criticisms\n\n**Framework Misalignment & Scoring Confusion**\n- *Agreement:* The critique is correct that my previous review parsed the proposal into Significance, Innovation, Investigators, Approach, and Environment, rather than using the three NIH Simplified Framework Factors—Importance, Rigor/Feasibility, and Expertise/Resources.\n- *Action:* I will now use the three-factor system, assigning ONE numerical score (1–9) for each of Factors 1 and 2, and using Sufficient/Insufficient for Factor 3.\n\n**Missing Required Sections**\n- *Agreement:* Additional review criteria—Human Subjects, Vertebrate Animals, Biohazards, Resubmission, and Additional Considerations—were only partially addressed. I will ensure all such sections are now explicitly included.\n\n**Non-compliance with Template**\n- *Agreement:* My previous review was not in the requested structured template. I will fully comply with the required format, including summary and justification sections.\n\n**Overall Impact Score**\n- *Agreement:* The overall score should holistically reflect the integration of the three Factors, as described in the Simplified Peer Review Framework.\n\n**Content Analysis**\n- *Rebuttal/Clarification:* While the content of my critique remains relevant, its presentation needs restructuring. I will draw from my prior analysis to better inform the new template-structured review.\n\n---\n\n## Revised NIH Grant Review (Simplified Peer Review Framework)\n\n```\nTitle: [Not provided—assumed “Epidemiologic and Historical Analysis of Eugenic Sterilization in California”]\nPI: Alexandra Stern\nActivity Code: R21\n\nFactor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)\n  - Assess Significance and Innovation.\n  - Determine whether the proposal addresses an important gap or problem.\n  - Evaluate conceptual and methodological novelty.\n  - Score (1–9): 2\n  - Justification: The project addresses a major gap in knowledge regarding the demographic, institutional, and experiential dimensions of eugenic sterilization in California, which conducted 25% of U.S. cases. The linkage of a never-before-analyzed dataset with census microdata for both quantitative and qualitative analysis, coupled with a digital archive, is highly innovative. These approaches have immediate relevance for ongoing ethical, legal, and policy debates regarding reproductive justice, demonstrating strong significance and originality.\n\nFactor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n  - Evaluate scientific quality, design rigor, reproducibility, statistical plans, inclusion, and feasibility.\n  - For human or animal studies, address adequacy of protections and inclusion diversity.\n  - Score (1–9): 3\n  - Justification: The proposal builds on extensive pilot work and features robust quantitative (regression, hypothesis-testing) and qualitative (archival, coding) methods. Data protection and compliance with IRB and HIPAA are thoroughly described. Statistical protocols (e.g., surname identification, missing data recognition) are sound. Feasibility is high given institutional commitment and existing resources. Some limitations due to incomplete or biased historical records and lack of contemporary controls are acknowledged; these are partially mitigated by sound methodology and thoughtful discourse about methodological caveats.\n\nFactor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n  - Evaluate whether investigators have relevant expertise and whether institutional resources are adequate.\n  - Mark as “Sufficient” or “Insufficient.”\n  - Sufficient\n  - Explanation (if Insufficient): N/A. The team includes recognized experts in history, biostatistics, and public health, with demonstrated capability in large dataset management and compliance with regulatory requirements. Institutional environment (University of Michigan) is excellent, with all necessary technical, analytical, and digital humanities infrastructure.\n\nAdditional Review Criteria (affect overall impact but not scored)\n  - Human Subjects: Retrospective analysis of historic patient records. Fully de-identified; strong precautions via REDCap, IRB, and HIPAA; minimal risk to subjects.\n  - Vertebrate Animals: Not applicable; no animal work proposed.\n  - Biohazards: Not applicable.\n  - Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions: This is a new application.\n\nAdditional Considerations (do not affect score)\n  - Authentication of Key Resources: REDCap system, digitized records, and census microdata all described and accessible per regulatory standards; digital archive framework provided.\n  - Budget and Period of Support: 24 months is justified by the scope of the work; budget is appropriate considering personnel, digitization, and analytic demands.\n\nOverall Impact Score (1–9)\n  - Provide a final holistic score reflecting the likelihood that the project will exert a sustained influence on its field.\n  - Score: 2\n  - Justification: This well-organized, methodologically innovative, and timely project is poised to make a major impact on the scholarly and public understanding of eugenic sterilization—not only as a historical phenomenon, but as a source of enduring lessons for ethical and policy issues in genomics today. The major strengths are in significance, innovation, and analytic thoroughness. Recognized limitations are inherent to retrospective archival work but have been appropriately addressed through proposed methodology, preliminary work, and data protections. Weaknesses are minor relative to the potential contributions.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Disagreement (if any)\nI agree with all substantive points of the critique and have addressed them fully. Where my previous review provided valuable content, that analysis is now integrated into the correct structure so that it is both rigorous and compliant with the requested framework.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThank you for the careful critique and guidance. The review is now fully aligned with the Simplified Peer Review Framework, employs the required scoring system, covers all additional criteria and considerations, and uses the correct structured format.\n\nIf you require further clarification or an even more granular breakdown for any review element, please advise.\n\nRespectfully,  \nconfig_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Gerardo",

Working with a dataset that contains 15,000 \nof these records from the period 1921 to 1952, and that comprises 25% of recorded eugenic sterilizations in \nthe United States, we seek to show the relevance of our historical findings to contemporary ethical, legal, and \nsocial issues in human genomics. Thousands of those sterilized under eugenic laws were deemed \"unfit\" \nbased on I.Q. scores and psychiatric classifications , or as delinquent due to their sexual behavior or petty \ncriminal records. While today reproductive autonomy is a cherished bioethical precept and a largely protected \nlegal right, we can learn a great deal from closely studying an era in which a particular variant of genetic \ndeterminism resulted in the state-mandated deprivation of reproductive capacity. \nOur specific aims are: \n1. To conduct extensive quantitative analysis using the eugenic sterilization dataset we have created during \nthe pilot phase of this project. This de-identified HIPAA-compliant dataset was created using REDCap and \nincludes 212 discrete variables for each of the 15,000 records. Using this wealth of coded data, we intend \nto describe patterns of sterilization according to gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, and diagnosis, as well \nas contextual factors such as patient's institution, medical superintendent , and family structure. \n2. To link the eugenic sterilization dataset to individual-level census microdata and tract-level census reports \nto permit population-based estimates of sterilization rates. By linking the two datasets we will be able to \ntest the associations of gender, age, ethnicity, nationality , diagnosis and other variables with the risk of \nsterilization . For example, we hypothesize that Spanish-surnamed patients and young teenagers were \ndisproportionately sterilized. Preliminary data analysis confirms this hypothesis for one institution , and we \nwish to test this hypothesis and a larger set of hypotheses related to social bias in and across institutions . \n3. To conduct qualitative analysis with the sterilization records, supplemental files, charts, and forms in the \ndigitized microfilm reels. Once our eugenic sterilization dataset is completed in summer 2015, we will be \nable perform keyword searches to identify themes, such as familial resistance to sterilization or patient \nrefusals, and to trace terminology trends over time. In addition, we will explore the meaning and limits of \nconsent in a context where sterilization was the precondition for institutional release. \n4. To incorporate our findings into a companion digital archive that features data visualization , historical \ninterpretation , and patient stories; this is under parallel development with digital humanities colleagues. \nWe will devote 24 months to quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dataset of 15,000 sterilization \nrecommendations (approximately 30,000 individual documents) that we have built with an internal pilot grant. \nWe will link the sterilization data to census microdata (individual-level data) constructed from the 1920, 1930, \nand 1940 censuses and tract-level data from the 1950 census, which will enable us to understand discrete and \nlongitudinal patterns of sterilization in and across state institutions. This rich data source provides a unique \nopportunity to conduct an empirical analysis of the practice of eugenics in the United States coupled with an \ninformative textual analysis of state-institutional practices. The companion digital archive will create an \nimportant historical resource for future researchers. \nDuring Year 1, we will create the census microdata set for all nine institutions under study; produce descriptive \nstatistics according to gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, diagnosis, and other variables; and conduct \npopulation-based quantitative analyses. In addition, we will undertake coding of the documents for the \nqualitative analysis of keywords and trends. We will submit abstracts to present our findings at public health, \nhistory, ethics, and ELSI community conferences , and begin to draft and outline peer-review articles. \nDuring Year 2 we will test hypotheses about increased risk of sterilization among particular subgroups by \ncombining the eugenic sterilization data set and the census microdata set. We will conduct our qualitative \nanalyses to analyze familial and patient objections to sterilization and to examine the limits of consent process \nin an institutional setting. We will prepare articles for peer review in scholarly journals and disseminate findings \nto history, public health, and ELSI communities . Relevant findings will inform a companion digital history \narchive under parallel development and for which we will apply for funding from humanities and history \nprograms. We will prepare articles for peer review in scholarly journals and continue to disseminate findings to \nhistory, public health, and ELSI communities . \nSpecific Aims Page 38 \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nRESEARCH STRATEGY \nSignificance \nDuring much of the twentieth century, eugenics was a popular \"science\" in much of the world (Bashford and \nLevine 2010). In its \"positive\" or softer form, eugenics manifested in activities such as better babies contests, \ninfant welfare programs , or pronatalist programs directed at groups deemed superior (Schneider 1990; Stepan \n1996; Kline 2001 ). In its more negative form, eugenics involved heavy-handed forms of reproductive control \nsuch as sterilization or mass euthanasia (Proctor 1988; Weindling 1989; Lombardo 2010; Black 2012; Hansen \nand King 2013). Genetic determinism undergirded both \"positive\" and \"negative\" eugenics although the former \nallowed greater latitude for environmental factors. From the 1900s through the 1960s, both variants of \neugenics influenced policies and attitudes on local and national levels in the United States (Paul 1995; Kevles \n1995; Largent 2008; Lombardo 2011 ). \nIndeed, many people are surprised to learn that in 1907 the Midwestern state of Indiana passed the world's \nfirst sterilization law, which authorized medical superintendents in homes and hospitals to sterilize people \nwhose deleterious heredity appeared to threaten society (Stern 2007). From this first law in 1907 to 1937, 32 \nU.S. states passed eugenic sterilization laws, which were used to control the reproduction of vulnerable \npopulations until the 1970s, when legislatures started to repeal these statutes. Over the period of about six \ndecades, over 60,000 sterilizations were officially recorded, principally in state homes and hospitals for the \nfeebleminded and mentally ill. Sterilization rates were fairly steady in the 191 Os and 1920s as eugenics gained \ncurrency, and increased markedly after 1927 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutiona lity of the \nprocedure in Buck v. Bell, a case that tested Virginia's 1924 law (Lombardo 2010). California passed the third \nlaw in the nation in 1909 and performed 1/3, or 20,000 of all documented sterilizations , the vast majority of \nthese between the 1920s and 1950s (Braslow 1997; Kline 2001; Stern 2005; Wellerstein 2011 ). \nThe broad contours of eugenic sterilization and coercive eugenics in the United States are familiar to many \nhistorians, geneticists, and bioethicists (Kelves and Hood 1993; Paul 1998; Buchanan et al. 2001; Andrews \n2002; Duster 2003; Mehlman 2009; McCabe and McCabe 2010; Comfort 2012) and it is not uncommon for \neugenic sterilization to be held up as an egregious example of early \"pseudoscientific \" human genetics. \nHowever, few empirical historical analyses of this practice are available. \n• Who was sterilized? \n• Were some groups disproport ionately sterilized? \n• Did racial or ethnic bias affect sterilization decisions and patterns? \n• Were age, gender, diagnosis, and nationality associated with a higher risk of sterilization? \n• How did sterilization practices and patterns change over time? \n• How did sterilization patterns and patient experiences vary from institution and institution? \n• Was consent obtained and how might we evaluate such consent with bioethical hindsight? \n• What happened to patients and inmates who protested sterilization? \nOur project seeks to answer these questions using a unique set of historical resources. In 2007, while pursuing \narchival research in California, Dr. Stern located 19 microfilm reels in file cabinets housed at the Department of \nMental Health (now Department of State Hospitals) in Sacramento , California. She soon discovered that these \nreels contained a treasure trove of data ---tens of thousands of sterilization recommendations from nine \ninstitutions along with supplemental letters, forms, and sterilization rosters (See Appendix A: Sample \nSterilization Recommendation Form). After receiving approval from the State of California Committee on \nHuman Subjects Protections and the University of Michigan Biomedical IRB (See Letters of Support), and pilot \nfunding from the University of Michigan, she began to collaborate with Dr. Kardia and Dr. Harlow to create a \nde-identified HIPAA-compliant data set that incorporates 212 discrete variables contained in these forms. \nThese variables include basic demographic information (Figure 1) as well as a long list of categories related to \ndiagnosis, family situation, purported evidence of criminality or sexual delinquency, just to give a few examples \n(for the full-length REDCap Data Capture Instrument see Appendix B). \nOver the past two years, the interdisciplinary team of Drs. Stern, Kardia, and Harlow has overseen the creation \nof this original dataset in Dr. Kardia's data laboratory at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. \nThis R21 would provide support for the multi-pronged data analysis phase of this project. For the first time, a \nlarge data set related to eugenic sterilization in the United States can be carefully and comprehensively \nResearch Strategy Page 39 \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nexamined through epidemiologic and historical analysis to track patterns in eugenic sterilization and recover \nthe stories of forgotten historical actors. \nS.ulc Demographic Information \nFemale Male Mlnlr.g \nIs the birth dat.e BY■ilable? \n·~1prow«¥ ... \nRace/Ethnlclty/Ancaslry \n'mu1,1provio.v-... \n,ersonal History YH \nNo \nNo \nNo lin.formaitlOn evelleblt \nWhito \nNe,gro \nCoio<od \nSpanish Sumame \nMtxkan \nChlntM \nJap11n11s.e \nlndl111n (Na:lve American) .... \nItalian \n\"\"\"' Portuguese -This project has the potential to reshape how several \nscholarly communities and the lay public understand \nthe history of eugenics and reproductive control in the \nUnited States, by demonstrating social biases \nassociated with demographic patterns of sterilization \nand by producing an interpretative mosaic of the \n,_ experiences of the thousands of people sterilized in \nCalifornia state institutions from the 1920s to the 1950s. \nAlong a similar vein, it can add a new dimension to \nunderstandings of consent in institutional settings in the \npre-bioethics era. Although consent for sterilization was \nnot legally required in California, and procedures for \nappeal not articulated until the late 1940s, \nsuperintendents at state homes and hospitals put a \ngreat deal of effort into obtaining signatures -from \nparents, spouses, or guardians -for sterilization \nrecommendat ions. Undoubtedly , this practice reflected \nIs thts a transfer patient? Otllv Wl«t ~-If tran5'« IS~ . Sf!Kt \"no\" 11 ltlet'e II M \nmtM.iOndlf'il'ISftr, concerns about liability and about professional \nstandards; the dynamic of consent provides a window \nthrough which to examine familial acceptance of and \nresistance to sterilization, patient refusal, and the extent \nto which sterilization became a mundane procedure \nsubject to bureaucratic habituation. Nalivlty \nFigure 1. Screenshot of REDCap Data Capture \nInstrument \nEven though the majority of these sterilizations occurred over fifty years ago, their after-effects inform \napproaches to reproduction and genetics, usually by standing as a negative example. We surmise that there \nare discomfiting lessons to be learned from our historical and epidemiologic analysis with respect to attitudes \nabout people with intellectual disabilities, the worthiness of certain groups to reproduce their kind, and the \nvulnerability of institutional populations. Thus, our findings, might offer useful historical keys for assessing the \nassumptions about ability and disability that insinuate themselves into routinized and often medically valuable \nprenatal and genetics tests. Moreover , the rationale of societal burden that bolstered eugenic sterilization in the \n20th century did not disappear in the 21st century. In 2013, an investigative report revealed that approximately \n150 women in California state prisons had received unauthorized sterilizations (Johnson 2013), many from a \ncontracted physician who stated in an interview that money spent sterilizing inmates was minimal \"compared to \nwhat you save in welfare paying for these unwanted children -as they procreated more.\" (quoted in Johnson \n2013). These revelations triggered an exhaustive state audit, which determined that unauthorized procedures \nhad been performed on 144 women from 2006 to 2010, 39 of whom were sterilized \"following deficiencies in \nthe informed consent process.\" (California State Auditor 2014). They also led to the passage of a bill in the \nCalifornia legislature prohibiting sterilizations in state prisons, which Governor Jerry Brown signed in \nSeptember 2014. This project, then, might shed light on a longer history of the sterilization of vulnerable, \ninstitutionalized populations in California. \nInnovation \nThe core resource for this project, the California eugenic sterilization database , is the result of an innovative \ninterdisciplinary collaboration . This resource will permit us to elucidate patterns and track trends that hitherto \nhave been demonstrated largely through descriptive statistics or anecdotal narratives . Two studies of \nsterilization programs, in North Carolina (Schoen 2005) and Alberta, Canada (Dyck 2013), effectively use \ndescriptive statistics and basic cross-tabulation to capture overall patterns and to explore issues of consent. In \nthe case of North Carolina scholars and journalists have demonstrated that sterilization rates of African \nAmerican women rose in the 1950s and 1960s (Begos, Deaver, Railey, and Sexton 2012). For California , \nChavez-Garcia (2012) utilizes sterilization data to demonstrate that minority youth committed to juvenile \nreformatories were more likely than white youth to be sent to state hospitals for sterilization. However, to date \nno study of eugenic sterilization has employed statistical analysis to test associations between demographic \nResearch Strategy Page 40 \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \ncharacteristics and risk of sterilization. We anticipate completing the data entry of all 15,000 files in summer \n2015. Nevertheless , using data sub-sets we have been able to discern important historical patterns, particular ly \nwith regard to the comparatively high level of resistance to sterilization exhibited by Mexican-origin parents and \nfamilies (Lira and Stern 2014). We have also been able to show that Spanish-surnamed patients were \nsterilized at high rates vis-a-vis their general population in the California in three institutions . \nFor all of its strengths, our eugenic sterilization database has a glaring limitation: the reels do not include \ncomparable yearly data from un-sterilized human subjects in California state institutions or the population from \nthe hospital catchment area. In order to address this lack of control data, a key component of this R21 \nexploratory grant is to create a complementary data set of microdata (individual-level data) from the 1920, \n1930, and 1940 censuses and tract-level data from the 1950 census in order to produce a population profile of \neach institution over four decades. In each of these historic censuses, the nine state institutions under study \nwere surveyed. By reconstructing the total resident populations of these institutions, we will be able to \ndetermine identical and/or commensurate demographic variables such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, age, \nand length of commitment. We will create comparable variables by reconstructing the population \ncharacteristics for each of the hospital catchment areas. More specifically , we will take advantage of new \ntechnologies to validate public records (census rolls) digitized through crowdsourcing methods for use in \nscientific enquiry. \nOur approach incorporates methodological innovation into a project characterized by interdisciplinary \ncollaboration. In addition, this project will directly inform a companion project to create a digital archive that Dr. \nStern is developing with colleagues in the digital humanities. This archive will utilize the latest methods of data \nvisualization including a wide range of interactive graphs and charts and tell the stories of those sterilized, in \naccordance with IRB and HIPAA requirements. Using OMEKA, an open source web-publishing platform for the \ndisplay of archives and images, Dr. Stern has developed a prototype that she will expand, as a separate sister \nproject, into a \"proof of concept\" for a digital humanities submission to the National Endowment for the \nHumanities and similar funding agencies. (Prototype viewable at: californiaeugenicsarchive.omeka.net). \nApproach \nOverall Approach \nWe will create a rich statistical portrait of eugenic sterilization in California using a dataset that includes \ninformation on the 15,000 individuals recommended for eugenic sterilization between 1921 and 1952. We will \nlink this data to census records of over 100,000 residents of sterilizing institutions in the same time period in \norder to estimate population-based sterilization rates and compare risk of sterilization across institutions and \ndemographic subgroups, and over time. In addition, we will conduct qualitative analysis on the sterilization \ndataset in order to find patterns, track changes over time, and understand nuances in the historical records that \ncannot be captured using quantitative variables. \nPlanned analytical approach \nWe will use Stata 13 statistical software (StataCorp 2013) to analyze the sterilization data and correspond ing \ncensus data (see Table 1 ). We will tabulate the total number of sterilization recommendations , by year and by \ninstitution, to document longitudinal trends. We will also describe the individuals who were recommended for \nsterilization according to their gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, and diagnosis. \nWe will use microdata (individual-level data) from the 1920, 1930, and 1940 U.S. Censuses (available through \nthe Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan) to create a companion dataset that includes the \ngender, age, nativity, race, and ethnicity of all residents of sterilizing institutions during the same time period as \nthe sterilization dataset. Individual-level data from the 1950 Census are not yet available, but we will use \ncensus-tract-level data from census reports to add information on the demographic composition of institutions \nin 1950. We will also consult institutional annual and bi-annual reports for population level data. We will link this \ndata to the sterilization dataset to estimate population-based sterilization rates, with residents recommended \nfor sterilization as the numerator and total institution residents as the denominator. We will use a case-cohort \nstudy design to compare risk of sterilization across institutions, between demographic subgroups , and over \ntime. We will use Poisson regression to test whether particular demographic groups (Spanish surnamed , \nfemales, individuals under age 18, immigrants) were more likely to be sterilized than others. We will also \nevaluate this cross-tabulated data vis-a-vis aggregate state-wide and county-specific census data that \nResearch Strategy Page 41 \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \napproximates each hospital's catchment area. We hypothesize that we will find that Spanish-surnamed and \nforeign-born individuals, as well as teenagers, were disproportionately institutionalized , and that certain \ncounties had high numbers of residents committed to state institutions. We also hypothesize that associations \nbetween demograph ic variables and sterilization risk varied from institution to institution. \nTable 1.

We will draw on standardized \nlists of Spanish surnames developed by the US Census Bureau (Word and Perkins 1996) and will also \nsystematically review lists of surnames to identify Spanish surnames misspelled by census enumerators or \ninstitution staff (Gratton and Gutmann 2000). (See Appendix E: Protocol for identifying Spanish surnames) . \nPreliminary Results: Sterilization recommendations (1935-1944) and census data (1940) at Pacific \nColony \nTo demonstrate our analytic approach, we have performed sample analyses on a subset of our data from one \ninstitution , Pacific Colony, for the years 1935-1944 (the decade when sterilization reached it numeric peak). \nSterilization reccn me11clalions, \nPacific Colony 1935-1944 \nUI 250 \nS 200 o i 150 ..

As displayed in Table 2, the majority of individuals approved for sterilization (56.3%) were \nassessed as \"Morons\", a category assigned to individuals with an IQ between 51 and 70. Annual institution \nreports from Pacific Colony indicate that about 35% of all residents were classified as Morons during this time \nperiod, versus 30% Imbeciles and 20% Idiots. This suggests that Pacific Colony was more likely to \nrecommend sterilization for patients classified to have mid-level IQ versus very low levels of IQ. \nTable 3.

No \nindividuals recommended for sterilization at Pacific Colony were flagged for violent crime. \nComparison of individuals approved for sterilization to total institutionalized population \nTable 4 compares general characteristics of the individuals recommended for sterilization at Pacific Colony \nbetween 1935-1944 to the total population of individuals living at the institution in 1940. The most striking \ndifferences are by age (67% of individuals recommended for sterilization were under 18 years of age, versus \n38% of the general institution population) and by ethnicity (29% of individuals recommended for sterilization \nhad Spanish surnames , vs. only 15% of the total institution population). Thus individuals under the age of 18 \nhad 3.3 times the odds of sterilization compared to individuals age 18 or older. Individuals with Spanish \nsurnames had 2.4 times the odds of sterilization compared to individuals without Spanish surnames . We also \nobserved statistically significant differences in odds of sterilization by gender, with females having 20 percent \nhigher odds of sterilization compared to males. \nTable 4.

Using data captured via \nREDCap, we will code for patient diagnosis over time tracking the different terminology used by the institutions \nand the changing description of the patients who fit these changing diagnosis criteria. Additionally, we will \nmanually code the data from letters of protest or non-consent in order to identify trends. We will evaluate letters \nwritten by patients who opposed their own sterilization and analyze all cases in which the patient, parent, next \nof kin, or guardian refused consent. Preliminary analysis shows that non-consent often involved religious and \nfamilial objections as well as disagreement about diagnosis . We will situate these in broader historical context, \nconnecting them to histories of eugenics, reproduction, and institutionalization. We seek to achieve a balance \nbetween the statistical analysis of trends and the personal experiences of patients; to ensure that this project \ndoes not forget that each of the 15,000 people sterilized during this period in these California hospitals were \nhuman beings deserving of dignity and justice. For example, the digitized reels contain 50 handwritten letters \nproduced by inmates in Patton, a psychiatric hospital, who objected to their own sterilization and wrote \nimpassioned pleas to agency directors in Sacramento (See APPENDIX C: Sample Handwritten Protest Letter). \nThese documents beg for historical contextualization and analysis as small yet important acts of resistance \nagainst reproductive control. \nWe will carry out our multi-pronged analysis in two overlapping phases. During Year 1 we will create the \ncensus microdata set, begin to test our hypotheses , and launch coding on the qualitative data. In Year 2 we \nwill test a large set of hypotheses , advance our qualitative analysis, and disseminate our findings via \nconferences, lectures, and poster presentations, and prepare articles for submission to high-impact peer­\nreviewed public health, history, and ELSI-oriented journals. \nTimetable for Project Activities \nProject Activities \nCreation of Eugenic Steriilalion Data Set {Entry Complete by Summer 2015} \nData AnalysE> {Expand Data.

It also proposes methodological \ninnovation, as we link the eugenic sterilization database to census microdata to order to conduct a population­\nbased analysis that to date has not been attempted. By joining historical and epidemiologic analysis, we hope \nto produce new empirical findings that will be of value to specialists and generalists interested in understanding \npast patterns and experiences of eugenic sterilization and reproduct ive control and contemplating their \nimplications for contemporary ethical, social, and legal issues in genetics, genomics , and reproductive health. \nResearch Strategy Page 44 \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nContact PD/Pl: Stern, Alexandra \nPROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS \nRisks to the subjects \nHuman subject involvement and characteristics: \nThis is a retrospect ive study using historical records without direct involvement of human subjects. The data \nset includes records of 15,000 people sterilized in California state institutions from 1921 to 1952. The data set \nwas shared with us in its complete form and we digitized it for the facility of manual data entry. \nThe individuals in the documents are aged 7 to 58 and include men, women, children, and vulnerable \npopulations, specifically those with limited mental capacity and diagnosed psychiatric disorders. The records \ninclude names, county of residence , and other identifying informatio n. Because we are using a pre-existing \ndataset that contains identifiable data, we have trained the entire data team to comply with HIPAA and patient \nconfident iality protocols. Our data capture system REDCap ensures that the master files are de-identified \nduring the coding process. Since this study will be conducted on data previously obtained for clinical purposes, \nthere is no chance of physical harm or discomfort to the subjects. \nSources of materials: The data for this study comes pre-existing historical records that have been digitized \nand are stored on a password-protected server. The original records were housed for many years at the \nDepartment of State Hospitals, and recently (with the assistance of Pl Stern) have been transferred to the \nCalifornia State Archives. The data from the records is entered into a database using the HIPAA-comp liant \nprogram REDCap. Data is managed and analyzed only by study staff, all of whom are included on the project's \nIRB and must complete appropriate PEERRS (Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research \nand Scholarship) modules. \nPotential risks: Use of this dataset will pose very minimal risk to exposing personal or confidential information. \nThe process of data extraction and input into REDCap does not involve the analysis of any identifying personal \ninformation. The data collected in this study is not of a sensitive nature. There would be no reason to believe \nthat by using the subjects' retrospective data that the subjects would be caused any harm, insults, injury to \nrelationships , loss of job or insurance , injury to their health or well-being. \nAdequacy of protection against risks \nData access and security: \nThe study team can only access the digitized sterilization authorizations on a password-protected server to \nwhich they will be granted access after completion of REDCap training, PEERRS training, and IRB inclusion. \nThey will extract and code the information from the digitized records on the server and transfer that data to the \nde-identified HI PAA-complia nt REDCap instruments . There is only one identifier field in REDCap during the \ndata entry process. Once data entry is complete, REDCap de-identifies the field so it will not be included in \ndata exports or reports. \nDigitized copies of the records are held on a password protected hard drive and locked in a safe box. All data \ncollection will take place in a locked office and on password-protected computers. No notes will be shared with \nanyone outside of the study and no information that could be used to identify an individual patient will be \ndisseminated or published . While REDCap is a web-based software, notes and data are not made available \nonline. In the unlikely event that the records are transported we will use a secure carrier only. \nPotential Benefit of the Proposed Research to the Human Subjects and Others \nThere is no potential benefit of the proposal research to human subjects and others. \nImportance of Knowledg e to be Gained \nThe analysis performed on the dataset has the potential to yield new understand ings of state-mandated \nsterilization during the eugenics era in the United States. The knowledge to be gained is historical with \npotential implications for contemporary bioethical issues related to reproduct ion and genetics. \nProtection of Human Subjects Page 45 ",

      "content": "Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi,\n\nI am config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Gerardo, AI assistant. Below is a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal as per the NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework. This review strictly adheres to the required structure, includes appropriate section scores, and addresses all additional review criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not provided; presumed related to “Epidemiologic and Historical Analysis of Eugenic Sterilization in California” or similar]  \n**PI:** Alexandra Stern  \n**Activity Code:** R21\n\n---\n\n### Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n- **Assess Significance and Innovation**\n- **Score (1–9):** **2**\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis project addresses an urgent, under-examined topic of high historical, ethical, and scientific significance: the demographic and institutional dynamics of eugenic sterilization in California (comprising 25% of all U.S. cases). The dataset of 15,000 records, meticulously digitized and coded, provides a rare opportunity for population-based, mixed-methods investigation. By linking this to census microdata and integrating rigorous qualitative analysis, the project is conceptually and methodologically innovative. The work is poised to influence multiple fields—including bioethics, genomics, public health, law, and social justice—by elucidating both historical patterns and modern lessons of reproductive control, bias, and state power. The development of a public-facing digital archive further amplifies its potential impact.\n\n---\n\n### Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n- **Evaluate Scientific Quality, Design Rigor, Reproducibility, Statistical Plans, Inclusion, and Feasibility**\n- **Score (1–9):** **3**\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe research plan is robust, blending well-validated epidemiologic and qualitative methods. Statistical analysis is guided by pilot data, detailed use of Stata, and transparent protocols for variable linkage (including surname identification and regression analysis). The team demonstrates strong compliance with IRB/HIPAA requirements, and the feasibility is reinforced by existing data infrastructure (REDCap, secure servers) and a completed pilot demonstrating analytic capacity. However, the project’s reliance on archival data necessarily limits representativeness and introduces the risk of missing or biased records. There is a lack of detailed discussion on managing missing data, possible selection bias, and integration strategies for qualitative and quantitative results. Despite these manageable risks, the approach is well justified and feasible.\n\n---\n\n### Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n- **Evaluate Investigators’ Expertise, Institutional Support, and Resource Availability**\n- **Sufficient**\n\n**Explanation (if Insufficient):** N/A  \n**Rationale:**  \nThe interdisciplinary team has demonstrated expertise in epidemiology, historical research, and data science. IRB approvals and pilot work demonstrate operational and compliance capacity. The institutional environment at the University of Michigan provides strong technical, analytic, and digital humanities resources, including secure data management and a supportive scholarly community.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Review Criteria (affect overall impact but not scored)\n\n- **Human Subjects:**  \n  No direct involvement of living individuals; exclusively retrospective analysis of historic records. All data are de-identified, handled with strict HIPAA/IRB protocols, and analyzed only by trained staff. Risks are minimal and protections fully adequate.\n\n- **Vertebrate Animals:**  \n  Not applicable; no animal work proposed.\n\n- **Biohazards:**  \n  Not applicable.\n\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:**  \n  New application.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations (do not affect score)\n\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n  Resource provenance (REDCap, census data, digitized archival records) is well documented and adequately secured. Pilot testing and verification of digital workflows further ensure data authenticity.\n\n- **Budget and Period of Support:**  \n  The 24-month period is appropriate for the proposed analyses, article production, digital archiving, and dissemination efforts. Budget appears justified by the data management and personnel requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Impact Score (1–9)\n\n- **Score:** **2**\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis highly innovative, timely, and rigorously designed project is likely to exert substantial and sustained influence in multiple fields. Its strength lies in unique data access, integration of quantitative and qualitative methods, methodological innovation, and capacity for broad scholarly and societal impact (via digital archive and publications). Feasibility is high given prior pilot work and institutional infrastructure. While some risk arises from inherent limitations of retrospective record analysis, the applicant proposes adequate mitigations and demonstrates awareness of these challenges. Remaining limitations are minor in light of the project’s substantial potential contributions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe proposed study addresses a critical, long-neglected chapter of American public health history using a novel, population-scale dataset and rigorous interdisciplinary analytic methods. It will generate new knowledge with clear relevance to modern debates about genetics, disability, and reproductive justice. The strengths far outweigh manageable weaknesses, which stem largely from the inherent constraints of retrospective archival research. The review panel recommends funding without reservation, encouraging only additional detail on missing data management and enhanced strategies for stakeholder dissemination.\n\nIf you require an expanded analysis or further detail on any factor or sub-criterion, please let me know, Dr. Adeniyi.",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nGreetings, Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi,\n\nI am config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Claudius, your AI assistant. I will now provide an initial structured NIH grant review following the Simplified Peer Review Framework.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** Eugenic Sterilization in California: A Historical and Epidemiological Analysis  \n**PI:** Alexandra Stern  \n**Activity Code:** R21 (Exploratory/Developmental Grant)\n\n## Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Score: 3**\n\n**Justification:** This proposal addresses a highly significant gap in understanding the empirical patterns of eugenic sterilization in California, which accounted for one-third of all documented sterilizations in the United States. The research is innovative in linking historical sterilization records with census microdata to enable population-based epidemiological analyses—an approach never previously attempted in this field. The project's relevance to contemporary bioethical issues in genetics, reproductive autonomy, and institutional vulnerable populations (as evidenced by the 2006-2010 California prison sterilizations) demonstrates substantial societal importance. The interdisciplinary approach combining historical, epidemiological, and qualitative methods represents methodological innovation that could establish new standards for analyzing historical public health injustices.\n\n## Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Score: 2**\n\n**Justification:** The research demonstrates exceptional rigor through its comprehensive dataset of 15,000 sterilization records with 212 discrete variables, HIPAA-compliant protocols, and sophisticated statistical approaches including Poisson regression and case-cohort design. The preliminary analyses from Pacific Colony (1935-1944) demonstrate feasibility and yield compelling findings (e.g., Spanish-surnamed individuals had 2.4 times higher odds of sterilization). The mixed-methods approach incorporating quantitative and qualitative analyses strengthens the design. The 24-month timeline is realistic with clear milestones. The team has already secured pilot funding, IRB approvals, and created the REDCap database infrastructure, demonstrating strong feasibility. Human subjects protections are exemplary, with de-identification protocols and secure data management systems in place.\n\n## Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n**Rating: Sufficient**\n\nThe interdisciplinary team brings exceptional expertise: Dr. Stern (PI) has located the archival materials and has deep expertise in eugenics history; Dr. Kardia contributes epidemiological and data management expertise with an established data laboratory; Dr. Harlow adds public health analytical skills. The University of Michigan provides robust institutional support including access to census microdata through the Institute for Social Research. The team has already demonstrated productive collaboration through pilot work and preliminary analyses.\n\n## Additional Review Criteria\n\n**Human Subjects:** Exemplary protections in place. The research uses historical records with comprehensive de-identification protocols, HIPAA compliance through REDCap, secure data storage, and appropriate IRB approvals from both University of Michigan and State of California.\n\n**Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable\n\n**Biohazards:** Not applicable\n\n**Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** This appears to be an initial R21 submission building on internally-funded pilot work.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n**Authentication of Key Resources:** The sterilization records have been authenticated through California Department of State Hospitals and transferred to California State Archives. Census microdata access is established through University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.\n\n**Budget and Period of Support:** The 24-month timeline is appropriate for the proposed analyses. Budget details not provided in this excerpt, but the scope appears consistent with R21 mechanism limits.\n\n## Overall Impact Score: 2\n\n**Justification:** This is an exceptionally strong R21 proposal that addresses a critical gap in understanding eugenic sterilization practices through innovative linkage of historical records with census data. The research has high significance for contemporary bioethics, exceptional methodological rigor, and a team with proven expertise. The preliminary data powerfully demonstrate disproportionate sterilization of Spanish-surnamed individuals and youth, validating the approach. The project will produce the first population-based epidemiological analysis of eugenic sterilization in the United States while recovering individual narratives through qualitative analysis. Minor limitations include the inherent constraints of historical data and the focus on a single state, though California's role as the leading sterilizer nationally mitigates this concern.

      "content": "Certainly, Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi. Here is a critical analysis of the review produced by config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Claudius:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Scoring and Alignment Consistency**\n\n**a. Factor 1 (Importance):**  \n- **Flaw/Concern:**  \n  The review assigns a **score of 3** for Importance but the justification language (“highly significant gap,” “substantial societal importance,” “methodological innovation that could establish new standards”) could support a stronger (lower numerical) score. NIH guidelines indicate that scores closer to 1 signal “exceptional” merit. The given language and the exceptional novelty described might justify a score of 2 or even 1, unless significant weaknesses are present.\n- **Area Needing Improvement:**  \n  The review should more explicitly balance strengths and potential weaknesses to justify why the proposal is not scored as “exceptional” if the strengths dominate.\n\n**b. Factor 2 (Rigor and Feasibility):**  \n- **Flaw/Concern:**  \n  **Score of 2** is described as “exceptional.” However, the justification mentions exceptional rigor and feasibility with “exemplary protections,” “sophisticated statistical approaches,” and strong pilot work. There is no mention of substantive weaknesses that would prevent a perfect score of 1.  \n- **Logical Inconsistency:**  \n  Without highlighting **any weaknesses** in Factor 2, the score is difficult to reconcile with NIH scoring conventions.\n- **Area Needing Improvement:**  \n  Either the score should be a 1 if it is truly exceptional, or some concrete limitation or technical concern with rigor or feasibility must be acknowledged.\n\n**c. Overall Impact Score:**  \n- **Missing Integration:**  \n  The review assigns an impact score of 2, which seems reasonable given the high praise throughout. However, the summary does not explicitly integrate how the minor weaknesses reduce the impact from “exceptional” to “outstanding,” especially since the only noted limitation is the historic/national scope—this is also partially mitigated in the justification.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Incomplete Address of Weaknesses or Limitations**\n\n- **Weakness Identification:**  \n  The review notes only “the inherent constraints of historical data and the focus on a single state” as the sole limitations—yet these could have important repercussions for data completeness, generalizability, statistical interpretation, and potential confounding.\n- **Unsupported Claims:**  \n  The claim that “The 24-month timeline is realistic with clear milestones” is made, but the excerpt does *not* contain timeline details or justification for pace/sequence of activities.\n- **Areas Needing More Scrutiny:**  \n  - The proposal’s reliance on historical records—not only potentially incomplete/bias-prone datasets but also the lack of contemporary verification—should be given more weight as a possible limitation for both Factors 1 & 2.\n  - Potential analytical challenges with missing data, variable data quality, or population comparators (control selection) are not mentioned.\n  - The use and integration of qualitative and quantitative findings is praised, but there is little evaluation of possible methodological integration difficulties.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Additional Review Criteria & Considerations**\n\n- **Budget:**  \n  The review acknowledges that detailed budget justification is missing but does not explicitly recommend requesting further budget detail or clarification—which is standard NIH practice when such information is lacking, even if not always fatal.\n- **Authentication & Data Access:**  \n  Some statements (e.g., “authentication through California Department of State Hospitals and transferred to California State Archives”) are taken at face value without a comment on adequacy or whether procedures were actively reviewed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Missing Criteria and NIH Compliance**\n\n- **No Discussion of Vertebrate Animals/Biohazard sections:**  \n  While “Not applicable” is stated for animals and biohazards, the template could be more explicit about verifying this.\n- **No Section on Resubmission/Renewal:**  \n  While addressed at the end, for completeness, explicit statement that “no additional reviewer response is needed” would show completeness.\n- **Additional Considerations Completeness:**  \n  The review could be improved by at least noting whether period-of-support, timeline, and budget are fully justified or lack key detail, to make sure reviewers know these were checked.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Summary and Recommendations Could Improve Constructiveness**\n\n- **No Actions for Improvement:**  \n  There are no constructive recommendations offered, either for addressing data limitations, potential stakeholder engagement for broader relevance, or mitigation strategies for limitations of archival data.\n- **Optimal Review Practice:**  \n  Good NIH reviews highlight strengths *and* offer specific ways to address limitations, even in strong proposals.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Clarity and Evidence**\n\n- **Claims Occasionally Overreach Evidence Provided:**  \n  “The 24-month timeline is realistic with clear milestones”—the excerpt provided in the proposal contains some timetable descriptions, but a more nuanced analysis of whether activities align with the timeline (or potential risks to completion) would strengthen the review.\n- **Integration with Provided Material:**  \n  The review gives some highly specific statistical finding (e.g., “2.4 times higher odds”) but doesn’t always link this directly back to how it affects the proposal’s rigor or innovation in the section rationale.\n\n---\n\n## **Improvement Suggestions**\n\n1. **Ensure scores are tightly justified and consistent with NIH guidance, especially when using language like “exceptional.”**\n2. **Explicitly acknowledge and analyze methodological or historical data limitations, including missing data, representativeness, and the challenges of merging qualitative/quantitative work.**\n3. **Request budget and timeline clarification where not detailed.**\n4. **Always pair strengths with at least one clear actionable recommendation or mitigation strategy—even for “outstanding” proposals.**\n5. **Make sure every section is self-contained and complete, explicitly addressing all review criteria, even when “not applicable.”**\n6. **Clarify whether claims about adequacy of authentication and data access have been thoroughly reviewed.**\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhile config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Claudius provides an analytically strong and largely compliant review using the correct structural template, it at times overstates proposal merit relative to the justifications given, is insufficiently critical about the limitations of archive-derived research, and lacks actionable recommendations that would help the applicant further strengthen their proposal. Tightening the relationship between scoring, justification, evidence, and constructive feedback would improve the completeness and utility of the review.",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nThank you for providing this thoughtful critique, Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi. I am config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Claudius, AI assistant. I will now provide a revised review that addresses the valid concerns raised while maintaining my assessment where appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**REVISED NIH GRANT REVIEW**\n\nTitle: Historical Analysis of Forced Sterilization in California Mental Institutions: A Mixed-Methods Investigation of Eugenics Programs (1909-1979)\nPI: Dr. Sarah Chen\nActivity Code: R21\n\n**Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)**\n- Score (1–9): **2**\n- Justification: This proposal addresses an exceptionally significant gap in understanding state-sanctioned eugenics programs that affected over 20,000 individuals. The work has substantial societal importance for disability rights, reproductive justice, and medical ethics. The methodological innovation of combining computational text analysis with oral histories could establish new standards for investigating historical medical injustices. The score of 2 rather than 1 reflects the inherent limitation that findings from California may not fully generalize to national eugenics practices, though the state's leadership role in these programs provides substantial broader relevance.\n\n**Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)**\n- Score (1–9): **3**\n- Justification: The proposal demonstrates strong scientific rigor with sophisticated statistical approaches including multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching. The mixed-methods design is well-conceived, with appropriate qualitative frameworks. However, several limitations prevent an exceptional score: (1) The proposal lacks detail on handling missing data and potential selection bias in archived records; (2) Integration challenges between qualitative and quantitative findings are not adequately addressed; (3) The 24-month timeline, while mentioned, lacks sufficient detail about milestone sequencing and risk mitigation; (4) Authentication procedures for archival access, while stated, require verification of adequacy. These concerns, while addressable, impact the feasibility assessment.\n\n**Factor 3: Expertise and Resources**\n- Mark: **Sufficient**\n- Explanation: Dr. Chen's interdisciplinary background in public health and history positions her well for this research. The institutional resources at UC Berkeley, including the Disability Studies program and computational infrastructure, are adequate. The partnership with disability advocacy organizations strengthens community engagement.\n\n**Additional Review Criteria**\n- Human Subjects: The proposal includes appropriate IRB approval and trauma-informed interview protocols. Community advisory board involvement is exemplary. However, procedures for managing potential re-traumatization during oral history collection could be more detailed.\n- Vertebrate Animals: Not applicable\n- Biohazards: Not applicable\n- Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions: This is a new application with no revision history to address.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n- Authentication of Key Resources: The proposal states authentication through California Department of State Hospitals and transfer to California State Archives. However, verification of complete access authorization and data quality assessment procedures requires confirmation.\n- Budget and Period of Support: The budget justification is insufficiently detailed in the provided materials. Specific allocations for transcription services, computational resources, and community engagement activities need clarification. The 24-month period requires a more detailed timeline with specific milestones and deliverables.\n\n**Overall Impact Score (1–9): 3**\n\nJustification: This proposal has outstanding potential to significantly advance understanding of historical medical injustices with direct relevance to contemporary bioethics and health equity. The innovative mixed-methods approach and strong community partnerships are major strengths. However, the impact is moderated by methodological concerns regarding archival data limitations, insufficient detail on data integration strategies, and gaps in timeline/budget justification. With these issues addressed, this work could exert sustained influence on disability studies, medical ethics, and reproductive justice fields.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n1. Develop explicit protocols for handling missing data and assessing archival record completeness/bias\n2. Provide detailed integration framework for merging qualitative and quantitative findings\n3. Include comprehensive timeline with risk mitigation strategies for each phase\n4. Strengthen budget justification with line-item detail\n5. Consider expanding to multi-state comparison to enhance generalizability\n6. Add validation strategies using external historical sources where available\n\n---\n\nThis revised review addresses the critique by:\n- Adjusting scores to better align with identified limitations\n- Explicitly detailing methodological concerns and data quality issues\n- Providing specific, action",

      "content": "Dr. Ezekiel Adeniyi,\n\nBelow is a critical analysis of the provided (config_R21_Stern_A_Ezekiel_Claudius) revised NIH grant review, detailing flaws, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas needing improvement:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Factual Inconsistency: PI and Proposal Data**\n\n- **Issue:** The *review refers to “Dr. Sarah Chen” as PI at UC Berkeley, using resources and partnerships not present in Stern’s actual grant application.* The original document, PI, institution, partnerships, and methodology differ.\n- **Impact:** This directly undermines accuracy and applicability of the review. Referencing the wrong PI and institutional environment is a major flaw; scores and strengths about “UC Berkeley” and “Dr. Chen’s background” are not relevant and represent unsupported claims for the Stern proposal.\n\n### 2. **Structural/Template Weaknesses**\n\n- **Positive:** The review now uses the structured peer review framework and covers required sections: 3 Factors, Additional Criteria, Additional Considerations, and Overall Impact.\n- **Weakness:** Review sections at times summarize or repeat content from the previous critique rather than providing a fully fresh and independently reasoned analysis.\n\n### 3. **Score–Justification Misalignment**\n\n#### Factor 1\n\n- **Score:** 2\n- **Justification:** The rationale focuses on “exceptionally significant gap,” “substantial societal importance,” “methodological innovation.” The only stated limitation is limited generalizability given California’s focus—but calls California the national leader.\n- **Flaw:** For NIH criteria, a sole limitation relating to generalizability (with justification that California is a national leader) typically would not drop from a 1 (exceptional) to 2 (outstanding). More explicit balancing of why this is a “2” is warranted; as written, the narrative supports a 1.\n\n#### Factor 2\n\n- **Score:** 3\n- **Justification:** Several valid concerns are named—missing data plans, qualitative/quantitative integration, timeline/risk details, verification for authentication and archival access.\n- **Strength:** The written justification does now closely fit the modestly lower score, an improvement from the previous version.\n\n#### Overall Impact\n\n- **Score:** 3\n- **Justification:** The summary notes “outstanding potential” and “major strengths,” but also “impact is moderated by methodological concerns,” now enumerated specifically.\n\n### 4. **Depth and Specificity of Critique**\n\n- **Positive:** The review provides explicit, actionable recommendations, e.g. handling missing data, integration frameworks, expansion to multi-state comparison, etc.\n- **Gap:** Some recommendations, such as “add validation strategies using external historical sources,” are mentioned but not clearly based on cited weaknesses in the proposal text.\n- **Missed Opportunity:** The reviewer could have discussed more on how the proposal (as presented) addresses or falls short on diversity/inclusion, data management, or future reproducibility—areas commonly required in NIH reviews.\n\n### 5. **Budget and Timeline Weaknesses**\n\n- **Issue:** “Budget justification is insufficiently detailed in the provided materials...” This is asserted without direct evidence from the application text. NIH reviewers may recommend \"clarification needed\" if budget is summarized, but must indicate how much of the proposal was seen and whether budget pages were reviewed.\n- **Recommendation:** Reference whether the critique is due to incomplete proposal materials or actual shortcomings in the applicant’s justification.\n\n### 6. **Areas for Additional Improvement**\n\n- **Lack of Detailed Evidence:** Some concerns (e.g., insufficient detail on trauma protocols for oral history) are plausible, but are not documented with specific proposal references.\n- **Duplication/Redundancy:** Some content repeats between \"justifications\" and \"recommendations\"—a more concise review would avoid duplication.\n- **Overly General Statements:** “With these issues addressed, this work could exert sustained influence...” is vague. It would be preferable to specify expected outcomes (e.g., impact on policy, academic scholarship, or community practice).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Synthesis**\n\n- **Critical Flaw:** The most notable problem is that the review analyzes a proposal with details (PI, institution, methodology) that do *not* match the document provided by the user, casting doubt on the foundation of the review. This error permeates the review, making it largely inapplicable to the actual grant under consideration.\n- **Score Justification Is Improved, But Not Fully NIHisive:** Factor 2 justification is stronger; Factor 1 (and overall impact) still have some mismatch between score and narrative.\n- **Recommendations and Weaknesses Are Now Present:** However, some actionable points lack context or evidence from the provided proposal.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n1. **Major factual inaccuracy**: The review refers to a different PI, institution, and proposal context.\n2. **Score/narrative alignment for Factor 1 needs to improve:** If only generalizability is cited and “California dominates the national picture,” a 2 may be too conservative.\n3. **Some recommendations could be better tied to explicit proposal details.**\n4. **Budget and timeline critique should clarify if due to absent materials or a real proposal gap.**\n5. **Completeness:** The review structure is appropriate, but content is only partially aligned to the actual proposal and often fails to cite supporting proposal evidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile structurally improved and now offering actionable—and in places insightful—critiques, this review is fundamentally undermined by analyzing a different proposal/PI. All subsequent scoring and recommendations should be based on the actual document and applicant to deliver a valid, evidence-based NIH review.\n",
