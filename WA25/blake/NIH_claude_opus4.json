The extent to which genomics will improve health outcomes on a \npopulation level, however,\ndepends in part on effective oversight. The volume of information generated by \nWGS and the uncertainty about\nthe utility of the data, the indications for which it should be used, who will \npay for it, and the extent to which\npatents and licensing affect access are all issues that command the attention of  \nthe policy community. The\ncurrent regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing and \nnewborn screening was not\ndesigned to integrate WGS into clinical practice. Thus, new policy approaches \nmay be required ta establish a\nsystem that guarantees appropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data \nand valid reports while\nencouraging innovation. The proposed study will respond directly to the program \nannouncement PA-11-250 to\nbegin to prioritize and address the unique policy challenges raised by WGS using  \na systematic consultation\nthat could be applied to future regulatory work in this area.\nWe have organized a group with expertise in three of the domains where WGS poses  \nunique challenges:\noversight of test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and the \ncoverage and reimbursement of\nWS. In consultation with an expert stakeholder panel, we will systematically \ndelineate and prioritize an\nauthcritative list of specific, tractable questions that policymakers should \nconsider as WGS comes to the clinic.\nWe will select three high-priority questions within our three domains, and work \nwith the panel to develop policy\napproaches to address them. This work will be informed by an initial landscape \nanalysis of the current and\nnear-future status of he WGS industry, as described by several of its leaders. \nBuilding on our team's expertise\nand extensive experience in both genetic testing policy and stakeholder \nengagement methods, we propose the\nfollowing aims to answer the call for regulatory science needed to inform \ndecision making in the face of rapid\ndevelopments in genomic healthcare.\nAim 1. Describe the current whole genome sequencing industry to establish a \nbasis for identifying\nand addressing related policy issues. To provide a clear understanding of WGS, \nwe will conduct the first\nU.S-centered landscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing on the \ngeneration, delivery, and\ninterpretation of genomic data. A review of literature, websites and company \nmaterials will be enhanced by\ninterviewing industry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS.\nAim 2. Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole genome \nsequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nto iteratively engage key siakeholders. Using our landscape analysis, our \ninterview data, and our\nknowledge of current standards and peclicy, we will develop a preliminary list \nof policy questions unique to\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nthe clinical use of WGS. A panel of 40 key stakeholders will then be iteratively  \nsurveyed to add to and refine\nthis list and to rank the resulting questions in terms of importance and \ntractability. An authoritative list of clear\npolicy priorities related to the clinical use WGS will result.\nWe will then develop policy approaches to address three high-priority issues, \none from each area of our team's\nexpertise: test quality and validity, healthcare reimbursement, and intellectual  \nproperty. We will systematically\nanalyze the extent to which current laws, professional guidelines, and industry \nstandards contribute to or\naddress the selected questions. Using this analysis as a starting point, we will  \nagain iteratively survey\nstakeholders to solicit and refine a variety of policy approaches to the \nquestions. The resulting set of\napproaches will be discussed by the stakeholder panel at a summit meeting to \nidentify areas of agreement and\nreasons for disagreement. A report summarizing how our methods and findings \nmight be applied to the\nbroader range of WGS policy issues will be developed and disseminated.\nAim 3. Disseminate findings to policymakers and key stakeholders. Beginning with  \nthe landscape\nanalysis, we will distribute our findings in concise, accessible formats (e.g., \nwhite papers, briefs, webcasts) to a\nbroad range of stakeholders to inform policy development. Two public briefings \nfor Washington-based\npolicymakers will be held to disseminate findings fram the Delphi process. \nFollow-up meetings with select\nfederal officials, Gongressional members and staff will be used to begin focused  \ndialogues on clinical WGS.\nSpecific Aims Page 101\n============================================================\nPage 2\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nRESEARCH STRATEGY\nA. SIGNIFICANCE\nThis application responds directly to one of the primary goals of the NHGRI \nprogram announcement \"Ethical,\nLegal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Genomic Research Regular Research \nProgram\" (PA-11-250},' which\nreads \"New legal and regulatory approaches need to be crafted in anticipation of  \nor in response to rapid\ndevelopments in genomic research and genomic health care....Research will be \nneeded to explore the effects\nof existing policies and regulations and to provide data to inform the \ndevelopment of new policies and\nregulatory approaches.â \nRapid innovation in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has brought us \nwhole genome sequencing\n(WWGS) that can be generated quickly and cheaply enough to be used for clinical \npurposes. In 1996, President\nClinton tantalized the public when he said: â I think it won't be too many \nyears before parents will be able to\ngo home from the hospital with their newborn babies with a genetic map in their \nhands that will tell them,\nhere's what your child's future will likely be like.â  Jay Flatley, CEO of \nIllumina, predicted that WGS would be\nâ technically feasible and affordableâ  by 2014 and â routineâ  by 2019.    \nExactly five years ago, in October 2008,\nthe cost of sequencing an entire human genome was $10.4 million; today it is \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n1,000 times less expensive.Â° The\nNHGRI has recently committed an additional $18 million to spur development of \nfaster technologies.* Some\nresearchers predict that five years from now it will be possible to sequence an \nentire human genome in a\nmatter of hours for $100 or less.*Â°\nDemonstrating the clinica] potential of these new technologies, whole exome \nsequencing (WES) and WGS\nhave already been used successfully to diagnose and treat disease,â  Â° and \ninsurance companies have agreed\nto cover the cost of WGS in at least two cases.\"' A growing number of diagnostic  \nlaboratories are adding next-\ngeneration sequencing to their menu of services.'* Some experts think genomic \nsequencing is ready for\nroutine clinical use.'*\"*\nAlthough the technology had advanced to the point where it can be used address \nspecific clinical questions an\nemerging consensus that the U.S. health care system does not have an established  \nsystem of procedures,\nknowledge and resources to effectively interpret and deliver WGS information to \npatients and providers.\nThe extent to which genomic medicine improves health outcames on a population \nlevel will depend on the\neffective oversight of clinical WGS. The current regulatory framework that \nguides single-gene diagnostic\ntesting and newborn screening were not designed with the complexity of whole \ngenome sequencing in mind,\nand will not suffice without new approaches or creative applications of existing  \npolicy.\nEric Green and Mark Guyer recently wrote that \"the amount and heterogeneous \nnature of the data, which will\ninclude both expected and unexpected results, will antiquate current mechanisms \nfor delivering medical\ninformation to patientsâ .'Â° The mechanisms currently in place are themselves \nthe result of extensive research\nio craft a system of regulatory policies that guide the practice of genetic \ntesting.'Â® The nature and character\nof the data referred to by Drs. Green and Guyer would seem to necessitate a call  \nfor forward-thinking policy\nresearch and guidance. New policy approaches will be needed to establish a \nsystem that promotes\nappropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data and valid reports while \nencouraging innovation.\nWGS's rapid transition to clinical use has prompted a wide range of initiatives,  \nincluding NIHâ s National Genter \nfor Advancing Translational Sciences,\"* and NHGRIâ s most recent ELSI program \nannouncement, '? and\nheightened the importance of efforts like the FDA and NIH's collaborative \nregulatory science initiative*Â° and the\nGenetic Testing Registry. In June 2011, the FDA held a public meeting to discuss  \napproaches to establish the\nsafety and effectiveness of clinical genomic sequencing. Likewise, insurers and \npharmacy benefits managers\nare creating positions for the management of genomics services.\nThere are numerous policy needs that require the attention of stakeholder groups  \nwith diverse, strong\ninterests in the governance of WGS. Among the many challenges we face are: \nensuring the quality and utility\nof WGS data and interpretation; defining the indications for which WGS should be  \nused; determining whe will\npay for it; developing systems of patents and licensing that maximize access \nwhile rewarding innovation; the\nResearch Strategy Page 102\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n============================================================\nPage 3\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nstorage and integration of data into medical records; issues of ownership and \nprivacy; personnel and training\nneeds; and whether the technology is best used for diagnostic purposes or health  \nscreening.\nWe have organized a research team with expertise in three of these domains: the \noversight of test quality and\nservices; patenting and licensing issues; and the coverage and reimbursement of \nmolecular diagnostics. WGS\nis likely to raise several important questions in each of these areas. How \nshould a WGS test, which could\nsimultaneously produce a result with clear utility, a result with unintended \nconsequences, and a result whose\ninterpretation will change with future research, be categorized under the FDA's \nproposed risk-based approach\nio regulation?â Â° How will insurers address the complexity of the information \ncreated by WGS technology? Will\nthe lack of clinical utility data limit or prevent coverage? Will clinical \nlaboratories be able to offer a camplete\ngenome sequence when some of the genomic landscape is restricted by intellectual  \nproperty patents?*' Are\nlicensing restrictions likely to reduce the utility of the available sequence?\nWith little empiric data available to answer such questions, there is a large \ndegree of uncertainty about the\nnature and relative importance of these policy domains. However there is an \nimmediate need for critical\nthought about what the policy priorities are and how we may begin to address \nthem.\nIn the absence of data about the validity, accuracy or utility of WGS, or how \nstrong the enforcement of patent\nclaims against WGS laboratories will we will develop a set of policy priorities \nfor clinical WGS by consulting a\ndiverse group of stakeholders, including WGS technology and informatics \ncompanies, clinical laboratories,\nhealth care professionals, insurers, regulatory and public health agencies, \nhealth economists, and patient\ngroups. The findings of this study will be driven primarily by the experiences \nand opinions of experts who are\ncurrently developing, monitoring and regulating the tools and technology for the  \nclinical use of WGS\nA modified Delphi process will be to elicit expert stakeholdersâ  input on all \nrelevant policy issues and their\nrelative importance and tractability. This highly structured approach to \nstakeholder engagement allows a\ngeographically and professionally diverse group of experts to anonymously \nprovide one another with\nquantitative and qualitative feedback about the ideas of others on the panel. \nAnalysis of this feedback can lead\nto a prioritized list of WGS issues as defined by the entire community of \nstakeholders, or a detailed critique of\npolicy options to address a given policy problem. Points of agreement between \nstakeholders and reasons for\ndisagreement can be identified. To ensure that this work is based on an \nunderstanding of the actual\ncapabilities and business models of WGS companies, we will begin by conducting \nthe first U.S-centered\nlandscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing an the generation, \ndelivery, and interpretation of\ngenomic data. Throughout the course of the study we will distribute our findings  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nin concise formats that are\naccessible to policymakers.\nConducting policy planning now, as this rapidly-advancing technology begins to \nmature, presents an\nopporiunity to evaluate and influence both the industry and policy options. This  \nwork will help to ensure that\npolicymakers have sound access to existing evidence and policy options based on \nwide-ranging expert\nopinions and rigorous research. A significant portion of the impact of this \nproject will come from active efforts to\ndisseminate our findings to policymakers in order to stimulate discussion and \ninform efforts to enact\nappropriate regulatory reform.\nB. Innovation\n[[This proposal is innovative in four ways. First, it will be one of the first \ncomprehensive projects to\nsystematically assess U.S. policy needs since whole genome sequencing (WGS) has \nbecome available for\nclinical use.'*'Â° Conducting policy work now, just as WGS is becoming \nclinically available and before this\nrapidly-advancing technology matures, will allow us to consider policy questions  \nas they arise in real time, and\noffers the prospect of influencing the early practices and expectations of those  \ninvolved with clinical WGS. Ta\ndate, policy work related to the clinical use of WGS has been largely \ntheoretical. Our propased policy analysis\nis innovative in that it is based on direct engagement with WGS campanies and \nother key stakeholders. This\nwill ensure a forward-looking description of the WGS industry, and the \nproduction of policy priorities and\napproaches that are grounded in a broad range of highly relevant experiences. ]]\nResearch Strategy Page 103\n============================================================\nPage 4\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nSecond, most policy work to date has focused on issues primarily related to \nsingle gene testing and is typically\nlimited to a single policy domain. This proposal explores and prioritizes the \nmast pressing policy questions\nacross three major areas: quality assurance, reimbursement, and patents and \nlicensing. The breadth and\ndepth of the project staff's expertise facilitates the simultaneous development \nof policy approaches in these\ndomains. By disseminating the policy priorities, we hope to stimulate the \ndevelopment of policy approaches\namong experts in other areas such as equitable access to services, privacy, and \ndata access and storage.\n[[Third, we propose using an innovative modified Delphi approach to ensure the \nsystematic incorporation of a\nwide range of highly relevant perspectives in our priority setting and policy \ndevelopment. Members of the\nstakeholder panel anonymously review and propose revisions to other panel \nmembers' ideas as the study\nprogresses. The results are conclusions that have been vetted from many \ndifferent perspectives at a high level.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of each policy approach, as viewed by the range of \nstakeholders will be of\ntremendous value as policymakers and stakeholders begin earnest discussions to \nguide the implementation of\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nW6GS. lf the Delphi process is successful and productive, it could result in the  \nestablishment of a framework,\nor methodological pipeline, to evaluate additional WGS policy issues moving \nforward.]]\nFinally, the direct dissemination of findings to the policy community will \nincrease the uptake and use of this\nwork. Washington-based policy briefings, issue briefs, and online media tools \nwill be used to distribute our\nlandscape analysis, policy priorities, policy approaches, and an account of the \nDelphi process. The expertise of\nBurness Communications will help to ensure the success of our outreach efforts.\nC. Approach\nWe plan to combine straightforward methods of landscape and policy analysis with  \na modified Delphi process,\nin which a diverse panel of key stakeholders are iteratively surveyed for their \nopinions and feedback, to\nsystematically identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\nto develop policy approaches to address the most pressing, tractable issues, as \njudged by our\nstakeholder panel. As with all policy analysis, the first step is to identify \nand clearly define the process being\ngoverned and the nature of the issues that need to be addressed. We will begin \nin Aim 1 by conducting the\nfirst systematic, landscape analysis of the current WGS industry to clearly \ndefine the business methods and\nservices involved in that are being employed to commercialize clinical WGS. To \ninform the development of\nforward-thinking policy, and gain first-hand knowledge of emerging business \nmodels, we will interview\nindustry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS. This innovative, \ncomprehensive landscape\nanalysis will provide a framework for identifying and prioritizing novel policy \nquestions, outlining policy-\nrelevant aspects of the WGS industry including self-imposed quality standards, \ncapabilities and services\nbeing offered, targeted indications and markets, patents held and health claims \nbeing made. This\nassessment of the industry's approaches to clinical sequencing will directly \ninform the development and\nprioritization of major policy issues related to WGS in Aim 2.\n[[In Aim 2 we will engage a diverse panel of experts to define and prioritize \nmajor policy issues related to\nWGS. A preliminary list of policy questions will be generated from the landscape  \nanalysis and our\nknowledge of current standards and policy. We will use a modified Delphi process  \nto systematically collect\nand integrate the opinions of ~40 key stakeholders. A modified Delphi process \nadds an in-person meeting\nof stakeholders and project staff to the traditional process of iterative \nstakeholder surveys.â  The \nstakeholder panel will be drawn from the WGS industry, including WGS technolagy \ncompanies, infarmatics\ncompanies, trade associations, and clinical laboratories; the health care \nsystem, including public and private\ninsurers, pharmacy benefits managers, healthcare systems, provider groups, \nprofessional associations,\nclinical geneticists, and genetic counselors; and policymakers, academics and \nthe public, including\nregulatory and public health agencies (FDA, FTC, CMS, HHS, PTO, CDC, Congress), \nhealth economists,\npatient groups, and intellectual property expert.***? Stakehalders will be \niteratively surveyed (see Figure 1).\nThe results of each survey will be summarized and analyzed by project staff, and  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nreturned ta the panel\nmembers for criticism and comment in the following round. A final in-person \nmeeting will be used to gather\nmore detailed opinions about policy approaches to three high priority questions \nThis process will result in\nthree products: (1) a prioritized list of policy questions for consideration by \nthe policy community, (2) policy\napproaches developed to address three of the most pressing issues as defined by \nthe panel, and {3} a\nsummary of the Delphi process as a technique for developing these approaches. \nThe policy priorities and\nResearch Strategy Page 104\n============================================================\nPage 5\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nthe resulting set of draft approaches will be disseminated in a timely and \naccessible fashion to federal and\nsiate regulators, genome technology developers, investors, health care \nproviders, and other stakeholder\ngroups in Aim 3.]] A preliminary list of stakeholders is found in the Appendix.\nThis project will leverage the expertise, insight, and working relationships \nestablished by an accomplished\nstudy team and a diverse panel of stakeholders to efficiently and \ncomprehensively collect and analyze\ninformation relevant to WGS policy decisions. In this section we describe: (1) \nthe research team and expert\nadvisory board; (2) the research plan and timeline; (3) potential limitations of  \nthe study; and (4} a brief\nsummary of relevant preliminary work.\nC.1 Research team and advisory board\nThe research team will be led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, who combine \nsignificant expertise\nin genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics with extensive experience \nengaging stakeholders and developing\nand disseminating policy options.*** Analysis of the oversight of WGS quality \nwill be led by Gail Javitt, one of\nthe nationâ s foremost experts on FDA law and CMS/CLIA regulation of genetic \ntesting quality and utility. Ms.\nJavitt led the Genetic Testing Quality Initiative at the Genetics and Public \nPolicy Center, which identified gaps\nin federal oversight of single-gene genetic test quality and delivered \nrecommendations to policymakers using a\nwide variety of formats. More recently she published recommendations for a \nblueprint of a genetic test\nregistryÂ®â  and led the GPPC effort to evaluate the policy implications of DTC   \ngenetic testing.â  This proposal \nbuilds on Ms. Javitt's prior work by applying her detailed knowledge of the \nregulatory bodies that have\njurisdiction over genetic testing to quality assurance issues raised by next-\ngeneration sequencing methods with\ndifferent standards, data output, reports and error rates.\nIssues of intellectual property, technology transfer, and relevant aspects of \npolicy engagement will be\naddressed by Robert Gook-Deegan, who is the director of the Duke University \nCenter for Genome Ethics, Law\n& Policy, and a leading expert on the effects of patents and licensing practices  \non genetic testing. Since 2009,\nDr. Gook-Deegan has published an extensive number of peer-reviewed articles \nrelated to human gene\n\n--- Page 8 ---\npatenting. Among his many contributions to the field are patent case studies \nthat served as the basis for the\n2010 SAGGHS Report on Gene Patents and Licensing Practices and Their Impact on \nPatient Access to\nGenetic Tests. The study will extend his work to consider policy approaches to \npatent and licensing issues\npresented by clinical applications of WGS.\nSean Tunis, Pat Deverka, and Donna Messner of the Center for Medical Technology \nPolicy (CMTP}) in\nBaltimore, MD, will address issues of insurance coverage and reimbursement \npolicies for WGS. As founder\nand Director of GMTP, Dr. Tunis is a recognized leader in the assessment of \nmedical technologies, including\nmolecular diagnostics, and the development of guidance for insurance coverage of  \nthese tools. As the Chief\nMedical Officer at CMS, he supervised the development of national coverage \npolicies and quality standards for\nthe adoption of new technologies by Medicare and Medicaid providers. He is \njoined by Dr. Deverka, an expert\nin the identification of policy approaches to improve the clinical translation \nof personalized medicine. At CMTP,\nDr. Deverka is currently engaging stakeholders on several projects related to \npersonalized medicine which use\nDelphi panels and other methods to set priorities for care. [[Dr. Messner is a \nspecialist in qualitative social\nresearch methods, including stakeholder engagement methodologies and use of the \nDelphi process to gather\nopinions on topics including FDA regulation, genetic testing, and gene \npatenting. Dr. Messner will lead the\nselection of the stakeholder panel and development of the Delphi process. ]]\nIn addition, an eight-member expert advisory board will provide guidance \nthroughout the project. [This advisary\nboard is distinct from the key stakeholder panel (Delphi panel) that we will \nengage in the Delphi pracess; its\nfunction is to serve as a sounding board for project staff, and to advise the \nproject on dissemination of\nfindings].

To anticipate\nthese developments as we draft policy approaches, project staff at GPPC will \nconduct semi-structured\ninterviews with a purposive sample of up to 20 industry leaders to seek their \nperspectives on the future of\nclinical WGS. Interviews will not ask leaders about specific business plans, as \nthis information is unlikely to be\ndivulged. We will recruit chief executives and senior scientific and business \nofficers from companies identified\nin the landscape analysis. Recruitment will cease when saturation of interview \nfindings occurs or 20 interviews\nare completed. Based on GPPC and CMTP's experience recruiting scientists and \nprofessional stakeholders for\nother interview studies, we believe we will be able to enroll 20 individuals \nfrom what we expect will be at least\n40 companies with at least three eligible staff each.\nAn interview guide will be drafted, piloted among advisory board members, and \nrevised. The guide will contain\na small number of general questions designed to evoke a conversational tone and \nelicit opinions about the\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nfuture directions of clinical WGS. Questions might include how participants \nthink WGS is most likely to be\nintegrated into care, or what companies need to do to prepare for the many \npossible clinical uses of WGS. We\nwill also use this opportunity to collect information about industry standards \nand self-regulatian. Telephone\ninterviews lasting 30-40 minutes will be audio taped using two recording devices  \nto prevent data loss. All\ninterview materials will be de-identified and kept confidential; no data will be  \nreported on the individual level.\nTapes will be transcribed. After all personal identifiers are deleted, \ntranscripts will be entered into the\nqualitative data analysis software NVivo version 9.0. We will apply an \nabbreviated content/thematic analysis to\nassimilate the interview data: a fairly simple coding scheme will be applied to \ncode transcripts for major themes\nrelated to the future of clinical WGS {e.g., \"emerging business modelsâ  or \nâ pathways to clinical integration\").\nThe entire research team will meet to review the coded transcripts, discuss the \nthemes that emerged, and\nintegrate the findings into the landscape analysis.\nEffective evaluation of the policy and oversight implications of WGS will \nrequire careful, ongoing monitoring of\nthe industry throughout the study to identify new entrants into the marketplace.  \nThroughout the course of the\nstudy we will search for emerging companies and business models, and we will \ndocument changes in existing\nWGS companies by regularly collecting screen shots of Web sites showing test \nofferings and changes in\nservices.]]\nffC.3 Aim 2: Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nthat iteratively engages key stakeholders. [[Note to reviewers: this Aim is new \nand replaces a more\ntraditional policy analysis.j}\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty about how whole genome sequencing will be \nincorporated into clinical\nmedicine, both generally and in the United Statesâ  healthcare complex. There \nis a general consensus that\nwhole genome sequencing will disrupt the patchwork of systems that currently \nguide clinical single-gene\ntesting and newborn screening, including existing codes and policies for \nreimbursement and insurance\ncoverage, appropriate indications for testing, standards to ensure genetic test \nquality, and intellectual\nproperty rights. However, the relative magnitude and importance of these \ndisruptions and the roles that\ndifferent governing bodies might play to effectively address these issues are \nnot well-understood. Scant\nempirical data exists to measure the performance of clinical WGS. Nevertheless, \nthe issues appear to be\napproaching rapidly and may overwhelm policy makers in a manner that is similar \nta, but perhaps more\nprofound than, the emergence of direct-to-consumer genetic testing.\nResearch Strategy Page 107\n============================================================\nPage 8\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nHenge ay uomyuiwie Foyronn menaw! yeueu Hau nanuiu ss reiuaieen ereerns\nIn order to efficiently prioritize\nand address policy needs in an Modified Delphi process to identify and \nprioritize policy questions related to WGS\narea with little empirical data and\na high level of uncertainty, we a _ Survey 1\nDelphi process, which\na broad range of experts and Study staff will use ranks to develop a list of \nspecific policy priorities.\nstakeholders.

Rather, our\ngoal is to conduct a structured discussion around expert stakeholdersâ  diverse  \npreferences with respect to\nthe future regulation of clinical WGS.\nThe first set of two Delphi surveys will be used to develop and prioritize an \nauthoritative list of specific\npolicy questions for consideration. The second set of three surveys will be used  \nto develop a variety of\npolicy approaches to address three of the highest-priority policy issues that \nfall within our project teamâ s \nareas of expertise. The \"modified\" Delphi process we propose concludes with an \nin-person meeting of the\nstakeholder panel and project staff.

The confidentiality\nand anonymity of participants' responses to the surveys will be emphasized. \n[[Based on the experience of\nGPPC, BCM, and CMTP with recruiting and maintaining expert technical working \ngroups, stakehalders,\nadvisory groups, and Delphi panels for multiple projects, we are confident in \nour ability to recruit high-\nquality participants for this panel. We have obtained letters of support from \nWGS technology and\ninformatics companies, and two provider groups. The buy-in of these \norganizations, aur interviews with\nindustry leaders in Aim 1, our dissemination of the landscape analysis to \npolicymakers (Aim 3),and the\npresence of industry and thought leaders on the advisory panel will all serve as  \ncatalysts for additional\nrecruitment. ]]\nPreparation of the Delphi Panel and Delphi Materials: Maintaining panel \nmembersâ  anonymity in their \nSurvey responses encourages unconventional or unexpected ideas and questions.*Â°  \nHence, each panel\nmember will be assigned a two letter code that panel members and study staff \nwill use to refer to each\nother during the surveys.â * However, complete anonymity can undermine the \nprocess; participants need\nconfidence that their fellow participants are respected peers. A brief group \nbuilding exercise will be\nconducted at the outset to develop this confidence. Panel members will be asked \nto submit their names,\n\n--- Page 14 ---\naffiliations, and areas of expertise, as well as their concerns and hopes for \nthe Delphi process. A summary\nof this information will be disseminated to all participants. Panel members will  \nalso be sent the landscape\nanalysis from Aim 1, which will provide important context for the identification  \nand consideration of policy\nquestions. The initial surveys for both problem identification and the \ndevelopment of policy approaches will\nbe carefully developed ahead of time by staff and piloted with advisory board \nmembers. Instruments for the\nlater rounds will be determined by the panel responses.\nIdentification and prioritization of novel policy questions posed by WGS: The \nstakeholder panel and project\nStaff will engage in two rounds of input to clearly identify and prioritize \nunique policy questions related to the\nclinical use of WGS. Prior to the first round of the Delphi process, the entire \nstudy team, in consultation with\nthe advisory board, will use our landscape analysis and our knowledge of current  \nstandards and policy to\ndevelop a preliminary list of novel policy questions we believe are raised by \nclinical WGS. This â straw \nmodelâ  of policy questions will be submitted to panel members for \nconsideration as the first survey.\nParticipants will be asked to review the issues, add issues, comment on any \nissues they wish, and rate the\nimportance, validity, and technical and political feasibility of addressing each  \nissue using 5-point Likert\nscales.â \"' The use of these scales does not exclude other forms of \nclassification of the policy questions;\nwe will consider the findings of our landscape analysis and recommendations of \nthe advisory panel to\nidentify other measures by which these questions might be categorized.\nThe team will assess and summarize the responses. The resulting annotated list \nof policy questions will be\npresented back to the panel, who will use a second online survey to review the \nissues, make additional\ncomments, and again rate the importance, validity, and technical and political \nfeasibility of addressing each\nissue. The feedback will be summarized to produce an annotated list of policy \nquestions. The questions will\nbe prioritized using the ranked scale data. Numerical values for importance and \nvalidity will be summed to\nform a \"Priority\" scale ranging from 0 to 8, while values for technical \nfeasibility will be summed to form a\n\"Tractabilityâ  scale ranging from 0 to 8. An Overall scale summing all four \nitems (range 0-16) will also be\ntallied. Median values for the individual and combined scales will be calculated  \nfor each policy question.\nNumerical priority rankings will be computed after sorting the list of questions  \nby median Overall rating, then\nPriority. A second list of ratings will be computed, sorting by Overall rating \nfollowed by Tractability. An\nannotated, ranked, sortable list of priorities with median values of each \ncomposite and individual scale will\nbe published and disseminated in a variety of formats to the broader stakeholder  \ncommunities to inform the\ndevelopment of WGS-related policy.\nResearch Strategy Page 109\n============================================================\nPage 10\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nDevelopment of multiple policy approaches to address the most pressing, \ntractable issues in our areas of\nexpertise: The goal of generating policy approaches is to provide policymakers \nand others with several\nalternatives to address policy needs for the effective integration of WGS. \nIdeally, alternative approaches vary in\nterms of timing, mechanism, distribution of burden, extent of federal and state \ngovernment involvement, and\nstakeholder support. The second round of the Delphi process will be used to \ndevelop approaches that might\nnot have emerged from a less structured stakeholder conversation that could be \nled or dominated by members\nwith particular viewpoints. The process will also provide a detailed \nunderstanding of where various factions\nconverge and diverge, and the nature of disagreements. These data help to \nidentify aspects of policy that will\nrequire negotiation and compromise.\nSelection of the policy questions to address: We have organized a team with \nexpertise in three policy areas\nidentified by the program announcement as important to the success of clinical \nWGS - analytic validity and\ntesting quality (GPPC), patenting and licensing (Duke}, and reimbursement and \npayment (CMTP}. We will\naddress the most important, tractable issue identified by the panel in each of \nthese three categories. We\nrecognize that the panel will identity several important issues that lie outside  \nof these domains, and we will\nencourage others with appropriate expertise to take up the development of \npolicies to address them. We\nwill consult the advisory board on our choice of issues.\nAnalysis of the current legal and requlatory framework surrounding the three \nselected issues: Each policy\ngroup (GPP, Duke, and GMPT) will prepare an initial evaluation of the current \nfederal and state laws and\nregulations, [[professional and association guidelines, and standards being \nadopted by the WGSj] industry that\napply to the issues being addressed. We will consider the intended purpose of \nthese rules, whether they are\nboth broad and precise enough to address the policy issues being considered. We \nalso will examine whether\nand by whom compliance with existing laws is enforced. Finally, we will \ndetermine whether there are conflicts\nor redundancies between different Jaws and guidelines that may need to be \nresolved. These analyses will be\nwritten up into white papers and disseminated to pane] members to provide them \nwith context for the\ndevelopment of policy approaches. Drs. McGuire and Kaufman will coordinate the \nefforts of the three teams\nfo ensure that they produce comparable evaluations that can be combined and \nexamined together.\nThroughout the study, regular project meetings involving all key staff will be \nconducted to ensure timely\nprogress, as well as comparable goals and products among the different teams.\nDevelopment a range of potential policy approaches: To begin developing policy \nalternatives, Delphi panel\nmembers will be asked to â brainstormâ  in response to the third survey  \nconsisting of open-ended questions\nabout how best to address the three policy issues. Panelists will be asked to \nconsider the landscape of the\nindustry and the current policy environment as well as more specific outcomes \nsuch as the impact on public\nhealth, cost implications for the government and stakeholders, and the impact on  \naccess to WGS and other\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nservices. Additional criteria for consideration may also be identified. The \nproject team will simultaneously\nouiline its own policy approaches using the policy analysis framework developed \nby Patton & Sawicki.*?\nCombining stakeholder input with the project teamâ s approaches, we will \nprepare a straw model of policy\nalternatives to address each issue. Following the policy Delphi approach of,â *  \nthe straw model will take the\nform of a series of resolutions and arguments supporting each resolution. In \nsurvey four, participants will\nrank the desirability and feasibility of each resolution, and the importance and  \nvalidity of each supporting\nargument. Panel members may add resolutions and propose supporting or opposing \narguments for\nresolutions. The staff will \"moderateâ  the discussion by feeding mean and \nmedian rankings, comments and\nsuggestions back to panel members for a final survey to collect rankings and \nfeedback. The staff will\ncambine and summarize comments in the case of identical arguments.\nBefore disseminating the policy approaches more broadly, we will review our \nfindings at an in-person\nmeeting of the Delphi panel members and project staff. This final round of the \nmodified Delphi process will\ntake place over two days in Washington, D.C. Findings, as descr\n\n[... Document truncated due to length ...]",

      "content": "Hello Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_claude_opus4, an AI assistant. I'll be reviewing the grant proposal you've provided using the NIH's Two-Agent Grant Review Framework.\n\n**Agent A - NIH Reviewer Assessment**\n\n**Title:** Policy Planning for Whole Genome Sequencing\n**PI:** David Kaufman and Amy McGuire (Co-PIs)\n**Mechanism:** [Not specified - appears to be NHGRI ELSI grant responding to PA-11-250]\n\n**FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1-9)**\n\nThe proposal addresses critical policy gaps as whole genome sequencing (WGS) rapidly transitions to clinical use. The unmet need is clearly articulated: current regulatory frameworks for single-gene testing are inadequate for WGS complexity, which generates massive data with uncertain utility and raises novel challenges for quality oversight, intellectual property, and reimbursement. The proposal's systematic stakeholder engagement approach to identify and prioritize WGS policy challenges represents methodological innovation in regulatory science. The timing is optimal, as WGS costs have plummeted 1,000-fold in five years and clinical applications are emerging.\n\n**Score: 2**  \n**Justification:** The proposal targets a significant and timely policy void with high public health relevance. The innovative use of modified Delphi methodology to systematically engage diverse stakeholders for policy development is novel. The work directly addresses NHGRI's call for new regulatory approaches to genomic healthcare, with strong potential to influence early WGS implementation practices.\n\n**FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1-9)**\n\nThe three-aim structure is logical and achievable. Aim 1's landscape analysis combines web-based research with semi-structured interviews of industry leaders. Aim 2 employs a well-structured modified Delphi process with 40 stakeholders across five surveys plus an in-person summit. The team's extensive experience with stakeholder engagement and policy analysis supports feasibility. However, some methodological details are underspecified—the criteria for selecting three policy issues from the prioritized list could be more explicit. The 24-month timeline appears reasonable given the team's track record.\n\n**Score: 3**  \n**Justification:** The research design is methodologically sound with appropriate use of qualitative methods and stakeholder engagement techniques. The investigators demonstrate relevant preliminary experience. Minor weaknesses include limited detail on stakeholder panel composition balance and potential challenges in achieving consensus across diverse perspectives. The feasibility is strongly supported by the experienced team and institutional resources.\n\n**FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources**\n\n**Mark: Sufficient**\n\nThe co-PI team brings exceptional complementary expertise: Kaufman (genetics policy), McGuire (law/bioethics), Javitt (FDA/CLIA regulation), Cook-Deegan (patents/licensing), and Tunis/Deverka (reimbursement policy). The eight-member advisory board includes leading figures in genomics technology, business, law, and economics. Johns Hopkins GPPC, Baylor, Duke, and CMTP provide strong institutional support. The team has successfully executed similar stakeholder engagement projects.\n\n**ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA**\n\n**Human Subjects:** Not Applicable (interview participants are professionals providing expert opinions)\n**Vertebrate Animals:** Not Applicable\n**Biohazards:** Not Applicable\n**Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not indicated\n\n**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS**\n\n**Authentication of Key Resources:** Not Applicable\n**Budget and Period of Support:** Not provided in excerpt\n\n**OVERALL IMPACT SCORE: 2**\n\n**Justification:** This proposal addresses a critical and timely need for WGS policy development as the technology rapidly enters clinical practice. The systematic stakeholder engagement approach using modified Delphi methodology represents an innovative framework for developing regulatory guidance in emerging genomic technologies. The exceptional investigator team combines deep expertise across all relevant policy domains with proven stakeholder engagement capabilities. While minor methodological refinements could strengthen the proposal, the work has high potential to produce actionable policy guidance that shapes the responsible implementation of clinical WGS. The direct dissemination plan to policymakers enhances likely impact. The timing is ideal to influence early adoption patterns before practices become entrenched.\n\n---\n\n**Agent B - Critic Review**\n\n**Critique of Agent A's Review**\n\n**Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:**\nAgent A appropriately identifies the significance of the policy",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\n**Assessment of the Project’s Potential for Powerful, Sustained Influence**\n\n**Likelihood of Sustained, Powerful Influence:**\nThis project is highly likely to exert a significant and sustained influence on the evolving field of clinical genomics—specifically on policy, regulation, and best practices for the integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS) into clinical care. The project addresses foundational questions regarding regulatory oversight, test quality, reimbursement, and intellectual property at a critical moment when WGS is transitioning from research into routine clinical use. By systematically identifying and prioritizing policy needs, and developing multi-stakeholder-informed recommendations, the project positions itself as a seminal reference point for decision-makers, stakeholders, and future policy scholarship.\n\n**Major Strengths Increasing Potential Impact:**\n1. **High Timeliness and Relevance:**  \n   The proposal addresses regulatory, legal, and reimbursement challenges precisely as WGS is entering clinical practice, filling a recognized policy vacuum and directly aligning with NIH programmatic priorities.\n\n2. **Innovative, Systematic Process:**  \n   The use of a modified Delphi technique to actively engage a broad array of stakeholders (industry, regulators, payers, clinicians, patient advocates) ensures that recommendations are both practical and reflective of the diverse forces shaping the field, thereby increasing the relevance and legitimacy of resulting policy priorities.\n\n3. **Breadth and Depth of Expertise:**  \n   The project team and advisory board are distinguished by their cross-cutting expertise in genetics, law, health economics, policy analysis, and stakeholder engagement, enhancing the credibility and quality of both methodological execution and policy outputs.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Scope and Proactive Dissemination:**  \n   The commitment to broad, early, and targeted dissemination (through white papers, briefings, public dialogues) is likely to accelerate uptake and amplify the project’s impact on actual practice and policy development.\n\n**Key Weaknesses Limiting Long-Term Influence or Feasibility:**\n1. **Dependence on Stakeholder Engagement:**  \n   The success of the Delphi process and the validity of resulting priorities and recommendations are contingent on active participation and sustained commitment from a wide array of external experts. Attrition, bias, or engagement fatigue could dilute effectiveness.\n\n2. **Rapidly Evolving Landscape:**  \n   Both WGS technology and its policy environment are undergoing swift changes. While the project’s real-time orientation is a strength, rapid shifts could make some findings or recommendations obsolete, challenging the project’s long-term influence unless findings are periodically updated.\n\n3. **Scope Limited to Three Policy Domains:**  \n   The project focuses deeply on analytic validity/quality, intellectual property, and reimbursement. Other emerging areas (privacy, data security, equitable access, secondary findings) are acknowledged but not directly addressed, which could limit the breadth and continued applicability of policy recommendations as new challenges arise.\n\n4. **Translation from Recommendation to Implementation:**  \n   The project is designed to articulate and disseminate policy options, but the actual process of policy adoption and implementation depends on external actors (agencies, legislatures, insurers), which may delay or complicate realization of impact despite robust recommendations.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe project is exceptionally positioned to drive foundational discourse and policy action in clinical genomics for the near and intermediate future. Its strong design, stakeholder integration, and topical urgency all bode well for a transformative—possibly field-defining—impact. However, realizing the full and lasting potential depends on maintaining stakeholder involvement, ensuring ongoing policy relevance, and bridging the gap between recommendations and actionable, enforceable reform.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Complete Failure to Follow NIH Review Structure:**\n- The response ignores the mandatory two-factor scoring system (Factor 1: Importance of Research, Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility)\n- No numeric scores (1-9) are provided for any evaluation criteria\n- Factor 3 (Expertise and Resources) is entirely absent\n- Additional Review Criteria sections are missing\n- No Overall Impact Score is provided\n\n**2. Format and Structure Violations:**\n- Missing required header information (Grant Title, PI, Mechanism)\n- The response reads as a general commentary rather than a structured NIH peer review\n- Lacks the systematic evaluation approach specified in the framework\n\n**3. Content and Analytical Weaknesses:**\n- Vague, unsupported assertions (e.g., \"highly likely to exert significant influence\" without evidence)\n- No specific citations from the proposal text\n- Overuse of promotional language (\"seminal reference point,\" \"field-defining impact\")\n- Failure to critically evaluate methodological rigor or feasibility\n- No assessment of preliminary data, power calculations, or experimental design\n\n**4. Missing Critical NIH Elements:**\n- Human subjects considerations not addressed\n- Vertebrate animals section absent\n- Biohazards assessment missing\n- Budget and period of support not evaluated\n- Authentication of key resources not discussed\n\n**5.

It provides no actionable scoring, lacks required structural elements, and offers superficial analysis without evidence-based evaluation. The response appears to be a general project summary rather than a rigorous scientific review. To be acceptable, the review must be completely restructured using the specified template, include all numeric scores with justifications, and ground every assessment in specific proposal content.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

The extent to which genomics will improve health outcomes on a \npopulation level, however,\ndepends in part on effective oversight. The volume of information generated by \nWGS and the uncertainty about\nthe utility of the data, the indications for which it should be used, who will \npay for it, and the extent to which\npatents and licensing affect access are all issues that command the attention of  \nthe policy community. The\ncurrent regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing and \nnewborn screening was not\ndesigned to integrate WGS into clinical practice. Thus, new policy approaches \nmay be required ta establish a\nsystem that guarantees appropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data \nand valid reports while\nencouraging innovation. The proposed study will respond directly to the program \nannouncement PA-11-250 to\nbegin to prioritize and address the unique policy challenges raised by WGS using  \na systematic consultation\nthat could be applied to future regulatory work in this area.\nWe have organized a group with expertise in three of the domains where WGS poses  \nunique challenges:\noversight of test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and the \ncoverage and reimbursement of\nWS. In consultation with an expert stakeholder panel, we will systematically \ndelineate and prioritize an\nauthcritative list of specific, tractable questions that policymakers should \nconsider as WGS comes to the clinic.\nWe will select three high-priority questions within our three domains, and work \nwith the panel to develop policy\napproaches to address them. This work will be informed by an initial landscape \nanalysis of the current and\nnear-future status of he WGS industry, as described by several of its leaders. \nBuilding on our team's expertise\nand extensive experience in both genetic testing policy and stakeholder \nengagement methods, we propose the\nfollowing aims to answer the call for regulatory science needed to inform \ndecision making in the face of rapid\ndevelopments in genomic healthcare.\nAim 1. Describe the current whole genome sequencing industry to establish a \nbasis for identifying\nand addressing related policy issues. To provide a clear understanding of WGS, \nwe will conduct the first\nU.S-centered landscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing on the \ngeneration, delivery, and\ninterpretation of genomic data. A review of literature, websites and company \nmaterials will be enhanced by\ninterviewing industry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS.\nAim 2. Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole genome \nsequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nto iteratively engage key siakeholders. Using our landscape analysis, our \ninterview data, and our\nknowledge of current standards and peclicy, we will develop a preliminary list \nof policy questions unique to\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nthe clinical use of WGS. A panel of 40 key stakeholders will then be iteratively  \nsurveyed to add to and refine\nthis list and to rank the resulting questions in terms of importance and \ntractability. An authoritative list of clear\npolicy priorities related to the clinical use WGS will result.\nWe will then develop policy approaches to address three high-priority issues, \none from each area of our team's\nexpertise: test quality and validity, healthcare reimbursement, and intellectual  \nproperty. We will systematically\nanalyze the extent to which current laws, professional guidelines, and industry \nstandards contribute to or\naddress the selected questions. Using this analysis as a starting point, we will  \nagain iteratively survey\nstakeholders to solicit and refine a variety of policy approaches to the \nquestions. The resulting set of\napproaches will be discussed by the stakeholder panel at a summit meeting to \nidentify areas of agreement and\nreasons for disagreement. A report summarizing how our methods and findings \nmight be applied to the\nbroader range of WGS policy issues will be developed and disseminated.\nAim 3. Disseminate findings to policymakers and key stakeholders. Beginning with  \nthe landscape\nanalysis, we will distribute our findings in concise, accessible formats (e.g., \nwhite papers, briefs, webcasts) to a\nbroad range of stakeholders to inform policy development. Two public briefings \nfor Washington-based\npolicymakers will be held to disseminate findings fram the Delphi process. \nFollow-up meetings with select\nfederal officials, Gongressional members and staff will be used to begin focused  \ndialogues on clinical WGS.\nSpecific Aims Page 101\n============================================================\nPage 2\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nRESEARCH STRATEGY\nA. SIGNIFICANCE\nThis application responds directly to one of the primary goals of the NHGRI \nprogram announcement \"Ethical,\nLegal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Genomic Research Regular Research \nProgram\" (PA-11-250},' which\nreads \"New legal and regulatory approaches need to be crafted in anticipation of  \nor in response to rapid\ndevelopments in genomic research and genomic health care....Research will be \nneeded to explore the effects\nof existing policies and regulations and to provide data to inform the \ndevelopment of new policies and\nregulatory approaches.â \nRapid innovation in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has brought us \nwhole genome sequencing\n(WWGS) that can be generated quickly and cheaply enough to be used for clinical \npurposes. In 1996, President\nClinton tantalized the public when he said: â I think it won't be too many \nyears before parents will be able to\ngo home from the hospital with their newborn babies with a genetic map in their \nhands that will tell them,\nhere's what your child's future will likely be like.â  Jay Flatley, CEO of \nIllumina, predicted that WGS would be\nâ technically feasible and affordableâ  by 2014 and â routineâ  by 2019.    \nExactly five years ago, in October 2008,\nthe cost of sequencing an entire human genome was $10.4 million; today it is \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n1,000 times less expensive.Â° The\nNHGRI has recently committed an additional $18 million to spur development of \nfaster technologies.* Some\nresearchers predict that five years from now it will be possible to sequence an \nentire human genome in a\nmatter of hours for $100 or less.*Â°\nDemonstrating the clinica] potential of these new technologies, whole exome \nsequencing (WES) and WGS\nhave already been used successfully to diagnose and treat disease,â  Â° and \ninsurance companies have agreed\nto cover the cost of WGS in at least two cases.\"' A growing number of diagnostic  \nlaboratories are adding next-\ngeneration sequencing to their menu of services.'* Some experts think genomic \nsequencing is ready for\nroutine clinical use.'*\"*\nAlthough the technology had advanced to the point where it can be used address \nspecific clinical questions an\nemerging consensus that the U.S. health care system does not have an established  \nsystem of procedures,\nknowledge and resources to effectively interpret and deliver WGS information to \npatients and providers.\nThe extent to which genomic medicine improves health outcames on a population \nlevel will depend on the\neffective oversight of clinical WGS. The current regulatory framework that \nguides single-gene diagnostic\ntesting and newborn screening were not designed with the complexity of whole \ngenome sequencing in mind,\nand will not suffice without new approaches or creative applications of existing  \npolicy.\nEric Green and Mark Guyer recently wrote that \"the amount and heterogeneous \nnature of the data, which will\ninclude both expected and unexpected results, will antiquate current mechanisms \nfor delivering medical\ninformation to patientsâ .'Â° The mechanisms currently in place are themselves \nthe result of extensive research\nio craft a system of regulatory policies that guide the practice of genetic \ntesting.'Â® The nature and character\nof the data referred to by Drs. Green and Guyer would seem to necessitate a call  \nfor forward-thinking policy\nresearch and guidance. New policy approaches will be needed to establish a \nsystem that promotes\nappropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data and valid reports while \nencouraging innovation.\nWGS's rapid transition to clinical use has prompted a wide range of initiatives,  \nincluding NIHâ s National Genter \nfor Advancing Translational Sciences,\"* and NHGRIâ s most recent ELSI program \nannouncement, '? and\nheightened the importance of efforts like the FDA and NIH's collaborative \nregulatory science initiative*Â° and the\nGenetic Testing Registry. In June 2011, the FDA held a public meeting to discuss  \napproaches to establish the\nsafety and effectiveness of clinical genomic sequencing. Likewise, insurers and \npharmacy benefits managers\nare creating positions for the management of genomics services.\nThere are numerous policy needs that require the attention of stakeholder groups  \nwith diverse, strong\ninterests in the governance of WGS. Among the many challenges we face are: \nensuring the quality and utility\nof WGS data and interpretation; defining the indications for which WGS should be  \nused; determining whe will\npay for it; developing systems of patents and licensing that maximize access \nwhile rewarding innovation; the\nResearch Strategy Page 102\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n============================================================\nPage 3\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nstorage and integration of data into medical records; issues of ownership and \nprivacy; personnel and training\nneeds; and whether the technology is best used for diagnostic purposes or health  \nscreening.\nWe have organized a research team with expertise in three of these domains: the \noversight of test quality and\nservices; patenting and licensing issues; and the coverage and reimbursement of \nmolecular diagnostics. WGS\nis likely to raise several important questions in each of these areas. How \nshould a WGS test, which could\nsimultaneously produce a result with clear utility, a result with unintended \nconsequences, and a result whose\ninterpretation will change with future research, be categorized under the FDA's \nproposed risk-based approach\nio regulation?â Â° How will insurers address the complexity of the information \ncreated by WGS technology? Will\nthe lack of clinical utility data limit or prevent coverage? Will clinical \nlaboratories be able to offer a camplete\ngenome sequence when some of the genomic landscape is restricted by intellectual  \nproperty patents?*' Are\nlicensing restrictions likely to reduce the utility of the available sequence?\nWith little empiric data available to answer such questions, there is a large \ndegree of uncertainty about the\nnature and relative importance of these policy domains. However there is an \nimmediate need for critical\nthought about what the policy priorities are and how we may begin to address \nthem.\nIn the absence of data about the validity, accuracy or utility of WGS, or how \nstrong the enforcement of patent\nclaims against WGS laboratories will we will develop a set of policy priorities \nfor clinical WGS by consulting a\ndiverse group of stakeholders, including WGS technology and informatics \ncompanies, clinical laboratories,\nhealth care professionals, insurers, regulatory and public health agencies, \nhealth economists, and patient\ngroups. The findings of this study will be driven primarily by the experiences \nand opinions of experts who are\ncurrently developing, monitoring and regulating the tools and technology for the  \nclinical use of WGS\nA modified Delphi process will be to elicit expert stakeholdersâ  input on all \nrelevant policy issues and their\nrelative importance and tractability. This highly structured approach to \nstakeholder engagement allows a\ngeographically and professionally diverse group of experts to anonymously \nprovide one another with\nquantitative and qualitative feedback about the ideas of others on the panel. \nAnalysis of this feedback can lead\nto a prioritized list of WGS issues as defined by the entire community of \nstakeholders, or a detailed critique of\npolicy options to address a given policy problem. Points of agreement between \nstakeholders and reasons for\ndisagreement can be identified. To ensure that this work is based on an \nunderstanding of the actual\ncapabilities and business models of WGS companies, we will begin by conducting \nthe first U.S-centered\nlandscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing an the generation, \ndelivery, and interpretation of\ngenomic data. Throughout the course of the study we will distribute our findings  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nin concise formats that are\naccessible to policymakers.\nConducting policy planning now, as this rapidly-advancing technology begins to \nmature, presents an\nopporiunity to evaluate and influence both the industry and policy options. This  \nwork will help to ensure that\npolicymakers have sound access to existing evidence and policy options based on \nwide-ranging expert\nopinions and rigorous research. A significant portion of the impact of this \nproject will come from active efforts to\ndisseminate our findings to policymakers in order to stimulate discussion and \ninform efforts to enact\nappropriate regulatory reform.\nB. Innovation\n[[This proposal is innovative in four ways. First, it will be one of the first \ncomprehensive projects to\nsystematically assess U.S. policy needs since whole genome sequencing (WGS) has \nbecome available for\nclinical use.'*'Â° Conducting policy work now, just as WGS is becoming \nclinically available and before this\nrapidly-advancing technology matures, will allow us to consider policy questions  \nas they arise in real time, and\noffers the prospect of influencing the early practices and expectations of those  \ninvolved with clinical WGS. Ta\ndate, policy work related to the clinical use of WGS has been largely \ntheoretical. Our propased policy analysis\nis innovative in that it is based on direct engagement with WGS campanies and \nother key stakeholders. This\nwill ensure a forward-looking description of the WGS industry, and the \nproduction of policy priorities and\napproaches that are grounded in a broad range of highly relevant experiences. ]]\nResearch Strategy Page 103\n============================================================\nPage 4\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nSecond, most policy work to date has focused on issues primarily related to \nsingle gene testing and is typically\nlimited to a single policy domain. This proposal explores and prioritizes the \nmast pressing policy questions\nacross three major areas: quality assurance, reimbursement, and patents and \nlicensing. The breadth and\ndepth of the project staff's expertise facilitates the simultaneous development \nof policy approaches in these\ndomains. By disseminating the policy priorities, we hope to stimulate the \ndevelopment of policy approaches\namong experts in other areas such as equitable access to services, privacy, and \ndata access and storage.\n[[Third, we propose using an innovative modified Delphi approach to ensure the \nsystematic incorporation of a\nwide range of highly relevant perspectives in our priority setting and policy \ndevelopment. Members of the\nstakeholder panel anonymously review and propose revisions to other panel \nmembers' ideas as the study\nprogresses. The results are conclusions that have been vetted from many \ndifferent perspectives at a high level.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of each policy approach, as viewed by the range of \nstakeholders will be of\ntremendous value as policymakers and stakeholders begin earnest discussions to \nguide the implementation of\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nW6GS. lf the Delphi process is successful and productive, it could result in the  \nestablishment of a framework,\nor methodological pipeline, to evaluate additional WGS policy issues moving \nforward.]]\nFinally, the direct dissemination of findings to the policy community will \nincrease the uptake and use of this\nwork. Washington-based policy briefings, issue briefs, and online media tools \nwill be used to distribute our\nlandscape analysis, policy priorities, policy approaches, and an account of the \nDelphi process. The expertise of\nBurness Communications will help to ensure the success of our outreach efforts.\nC. Approach\nWe plan to combine straightforward methods of landscape and policy analysis with  \na modified Delphi process,\nin which a diverse panel of key stakeholders are iteratively surveyed for their \nopinions and feedback, to\nsystematically identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\nto develop policy approaches to address the most pressing, tractable issues, as \njudged by our\nstakeholder panel. As with all policy analysis, the first step is to identify \nand clearly define the process being\ngoverned and the nature of the issues that need to be addressed. We will begin \nin Aim 1 by conducting the\nfirst systematic, landscape analysis of the current WGS industry to clearly \ndefine the business methods and\nservices involved in that are being employed to commercialize clinical WGS. To \ninform the development of\nforward-thinking policy, and gain first-hand knowledge of emerging business \nmodels, we will interview\nindustry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS. This innovative, \ncomprehensive landscape\nanalysis will provide a framework for identifying and prioritizing novel policy \nquestions, outlining policy-\nrelevant aspects of the WGS industry including self-imposed quality standards, \ncapabilities and services\nbeing offered, targeted indications and markets, patents held and health claims \nbeing made. This\nassessment of the industry's approaches to clinical sequencing will directly \ninform the development and\nprioritization of major policy issues related to WGS in Aim 2.\n[[In Aim 2 we will engage a diverse panel of experts to define and prioritize \nmajor policy issues related to\nWGS. A preliminary list of policy questions will be generated from the landscape  \nanalysis and our\nknowledge of current standards and policy. We will use a modified Delphi process  \nto systematically collect\nand integrate the opinions of ~40 key stakeholders. A modified Delphi process \nadds an in-person meeting\nof stakeholders and project staff to the traditional process of iterative \nstakeholder surveys.â  The \nstakeholder panel will be drawn from the WGS industry, including WGS technolagy \ncompanies, infarmatics\ncompanies, trade associations, and clinical laboratories; the health care \nsystem, including public and private\ninsurers, pharmacy benefits managers, healthcare systems, provider groups, \nprofessional associations,\nclinical geneticists, and genetic counselors; and policymakers, academics and \nthe public, including\nregulatory and public health agencies (FDA, FTC, CMS, HHS, PTO, CDC, Congress), \nhealth economists,\npatient groups, and intellectual property expert.***? Stakehalders will be \niteratively surveyed (see Figure 1).\nThe results of each survey will be summarized and analyzed by project staff, and  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nreturned ta the panel\nmembers for criticism and comment in the following round. A final in-person \nmeeting will be used to gather\nmore detailed opinions about policy approaches to three high priority questions \nThis process will result in\nthree products: (1) a prioritized list of policy questions for consideration by \nthe policy community, (2) policy\napproaches developed to address three of the most pressing issues as defined by \nthe panel, and {3} a\nsummary of the Delphi process as a technique for developing these approaches. \nThe policy priorities and\nResearch Strategy Page 104\n============================================================\nPage 5\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nthe resulting set of draft approaches will be disseminated in a timely and \naccessible fashion to federal and\nsiate regulators, genome technology developers, investors, health care \nproviders, and other stakeholder\ngroups in Aim 3.]] A preliminary list of stakeholders is found in the Appendix.\nThis project will leverage the expertise, insight, and working relationships \nestablished by an accomplished\nstudy team and a diverse panel of stakeholders to efficiently and \ncomprehensively collect and analyze\ninformation relevant to WGS policy decisions. In this section we describe: (1) \nthe research team and expert\nadvisory board; (2) the research plan and timeline; (3) potential limitations of  \nthe study; and (4} a brief\nsummary of relevant preliminary work.\nC.1 Research team and advisory board\nThe research team will be led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, who combine \nsignificant expertise\nin genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics with extensive experience \nengaging stakeholders and developing\nand disseminating policy options.*** Analysis of the oversight of WGS quality \nwill be led by Gail Javitt, one of\nthe nationâ s foremost experts on FDA law and CMS/CLIA regulation of genetic \ntesting quality and utility. Ms.\nJavitt led the Genetic Testing Quality Initiative at the Genetics and Public \nPolicy Center, which identified gaps\nin federal oversight of single-gene genetic test quality and delivered \nrecommendations to policymakers using a\nwide variety of formats. More recently she published recommendations for a \nblueprint of a genetic test\nregistryÂ®â  and led the GPPC effort to evaluate the policy implications of DTC   \ngenetic testing.â  This proposal \nbuilds on Ms. Javitt's prior work by applying her detailed knowledge of the \nregulatory bodies that have\njurisdiction over genetic testing to quality assurance issues raised by next-\ngeneration sequencing methods with\ndifferent standards, data output, reports and error rates.\nIssues of intellectual property, technology transfer, and relevant aspects of \npolicy engagement will be\naddressed by Robert Gook-Deegan, who is the director of the Duke University \nCenter for Genome Ethics, Law\n& Policy, and a leading expert on the effects of patents and licensing practices  \non genetic testing. Since 2009,\nDr. Gook-Deegan has published an extensive number of peer-reviewed articles \nrelated to human gene\n\n--- Page 8 ---\npatenting. Among his many contributions to the field are patent case studies \nthat served as the basis for the\n2010 SAGGHS Report on Gene Patents and Licensing Practices and Their Impact on \nPatient Access to\nGenetic Tests. The study will extend his work to consider policy approaches to \npatent and licensing issues\npresented by clinical applications of WGS.\nSean Tunis, Pat Deverka, and Donna Messner of the Center for Medical Technology \nPolicy (CMTP}) in\nBaltimore, MD, will address issues of insurance coverage and reimbursement \npolicies for WGS. As founder\nand Director of GMTP, Dr. Tunis is a recognized leader in the assessment of \nmedical technologies, including\nmolecular diagnostics, and the development of guidance for insurance coverage of  \nthese tools. As the Chief\nMedical Officer at CMS, he supervised the development of national coverage \npolicies and quality standards for\nthe adoption of new technologies by Medicare and Medicaid providers. He is \njoined by Dr. Deverka, an expert\nin the identification of policy approaches to improve the clinical translation \nof personalized medicine. At CMTP,\nDr. Deverka is currently engaging stakeholders on several projects related to \npersonalized medicine which use\nDelphi panels and other methods to set priorities for care. [[Dr. Messner is a \nspecialist in qualitative social\nresearch methods, including stakeholder engagement methodologies and use of the \nDelphi process to gather\nopinions on topics including FDA regulation, genetic testing, and gene \npatenting.

We also intend \nfor this resource ta be regularly\nupdated and used by the wider research and policy communities.\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nWeb-based landscape analysis: Drawing on our experience monitoring companies \noffering direct-to-cansumer\n(DTC) genetic testing,â ¢ we will systematically identify and track WGS \ncompanies (Table 1). We will include\ncompanies, universities and other entities developing whole genome sequencing \ntechnologies and equipment,\nproviding sequencing services (whole or exomic), or offering clinical annotation  \nor interpretation of sequence\ndata. Companies involved in WGS will be identified by searching the Internet and  \nPubMed using relevant\nsearch terms such as â whole genome sequencing,â  \"examic sequencing,â    \nâ next-generation sequencing,â  , \n\"nexi-nexi-generation sequencingâ , \"genomic(s)\", â personalized medicine\",  \nâ individualized medicine\" and\nâ personal genomeâ  and monitoring media reports through searches of NEXIS.

We will classify the range \nof business models used to\npromote and deliver WGS based on the policy-relevant information we collect. We \nwill refine and narrow\nResearch Strategy Page 106\n============================================================\nPage 7\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nour definition of WGS companies, eliminating any that are not offering relevant \nproducts or services. The\nlandscape report will include sections identifying the companies, the service \nmodels for clinical WGS, the\nmarkets being addressed, and who is paying for the services.\n[Interviews with industry leaders: WGS business models and technologies are \nchanging rapidly. To anticipate\nthese developments as we draft policy approaches, project staff at GPPC will \nconduct semi-structured\ninterviews with a purposive sample of up to 20 industry leaders to seek their \nperspectives on the future of\nclinical WGS. Interviews will not ask leaders about specific business plans, as \nthis information is unlikely to be\ndivulged. We will recruit chief executives and senior scientific and business \nofficers from companies identified\nin the landscape analysis. Recruitment will cease when saturation of interview \nfindings occurs or 20 interviews\nare completed. Based on GPPC and CMTP's experience recruiting scientists and \nprofessional stakeholders for\nother interview studies, we believe we will be able to enroll 20 individuals \nfrom what we expect will be at least\n40 companies with at least three eligible staff each.\nAn interview guide will be drafted, piloted among advisory board members, and \nrevised. The guide will contain\na small number of general questions designed to evoke a conversational tone and \nelicit opinions about the\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nfuture directions of clinical WGS. Questions might include how participants \nthink WGS is most likely to be\nintegrated into care, or what companies need to do to prepare for the many \npossible clinical uses of WGS. We\nwill also use this opportunity to collect information about industry standards \nand self-regulatian. Telephone\ninterviews lasting 30-40 minutes will be audio taped using two recording devices  \nto prevent data loss. All\ninterview materials will be de-identified and kept confidential; no data will be  \nreported on the individual level.\nTapes will be transcribed. After all personal identifiers are deleted, \ntranscripts will be entered into the\nqualitative data analysis software NVivo version 9.0. We will apply an \nabbreviated content/thematic analysis to\nassimilate the interview data: a fairly simple coding scheme will be applied to \ncode transcripts for major themes\nrelated to the future of clinical WGS {e.g., \"emerging business modelsâ  or \nâ pathways to clinical integration\").\nThe entire research team will meet to review the coded transcripts, discuss the \nthemes that emerged, and\nintegrate the findings into the landscape analysis.\nEffective evaluation of the policy and oversight implications of WGS will \nrequire careful, ongoing monitoring of\nthe industry throughout the study to identify new entrants into the marketplace.  \nThroughout the course of the\nstudy we will search for emerging companies and business models, and we will \ndocument changes in existing\nWGS companies by regularly collecting screen shots of Web sites showing test \nofferings and changes in\nservices.]]\nffC.3 Aim 2: Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nthat iteratively engages key stakeholders. [[Note to reviewers: this Aim is new \nand replaces a more\ntraditional policy analysis.j}\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty about how whole genome sequencing will be \nincorporated into clinical\nmedicine, both generally and in the United Statesâ  healthcare complex. There \nis a general consensus that\nwhole genome sequencing will disrupt the patchwork of systems that currently \nguide clinical single-gene\ntesting and newborn screening, including existing codes and policies for \nreimbursement and insurance\ncoverage, appropriate indications for testing, standards to ensure genetic test \nquality, and intellectual\nproperty rights. However, the relative magnitude and importance of these \ndisruptions and the roles that\ndifferent governing bodies might play to effectively address these issues are \nnot well-understood. Scant\nempirical data exists to measure the performance of clinical WGS. Nevertheless, \nthe issues appear to be\napproaching rapidly and may overwhelm policy makers in a manner that is similar \nta, but perhaps more\nprofound than, the emergence of direct-to-consumer genetic testing.\nResearch Strategy Page 107\n============================================================\nPage 8\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nHenge ay uomyuiwie Foyronn menaw! yeueu Hau nanuiu ss reiuaieen ereerns\nIn order to efficiently prioritize\nand address policy needs in an Modified Delphi process to identify and \nprioritize policy questions related to WGS\narea with little empirical data and\na high level of uncertainty, we a _ Survey 1\nDelphi process, which\na broad range of experts and Study staff will use ranks to develop a list of \nspecific policy priorities.\nstakeholders.

Achieving consensus, however, is not the \ngoal of the work prapased\nhere, as complete agreement is an unrealistic expectation for the diverse group \nwe will query. Rather, our\ngoal is to conduct a structured discussion around expert stakeholdersâ  diverse  \npreferences with respect to\nthe future regulation of clinical WGS.\nThe first set of two Delphi surveys will be used to develop and prioritize an \nauthoritative list of specific\npolicy questions for consideration. The second set of three surveys will be used  \nto develop a variety of\npolicy approaches to address three of the highest-priority policy issues that \nfall within our project teamâ s \nareas of expertise. The \"modified\" Delphi process we propose concludes with an \nin-person meeting of the\nstakeholder panel and project staff. This meeting provides the opportunity for \nan in-depth conversation to\nexplore the complexity of the various policy approaches, identify areas of broad  \nagreement, and clarify\nreasons for disagreement.**? By providing a forum for the experts to review our \nsummaries of the surveys,\nihe meeting can also lead to improved construct validity of the Delphi \nprocessÂ®â . \nRecruitment of the Delphi Panel: Forty candidates will be selected to represent \nthe fallowing categories of\nstakeholders: the WGS indusiry, including WGS technology companies, informatics \ncompanies, trade\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nassociations, and clinical laboratories: the health care system, including \npublic and private insurers,\npharmacy benefits managers, healthcare systems, provider groups, professional \nassociations, clinical\ngeneticists, and genetic counselors: and policymakers, academics and the public \nincluding regulatory and\npublic health agencies (FDA, FTC, CMS, HHS, PTO, CDC, Congress), health \neconomists, patient groups,\nand intellectual property experts.

The \nvalidity of the Delphi process\nResearch Strategy Page 108\n============================================================\nPage 9\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\ndoes not depend on recruiting large or representative samples. A sample size of \n40 panel members will\naccommodate all relevant stakeholder groups while maintaining an \nadministratively manageable graup.*?%9\nOnce personal assurances of participation are obtained, non-response and \nattrition rates in Delphi\nprocesses tend to be very low.?â \nIt is imperative that participants understand the nature of the Delphi process. \nTo this end, recruitment will\ninclude a detailed overview of the purpose, tasks, and timeline of the process, \nwhich will involve five online\nsurveys and a two-day meeting in Washington, D.C. spanning the course of 20 \nmonths. The confidentiality\nand anonymity of participants' responses to the surveys will be emphasized. \n[[Based on the experience of\nGPPC, BCM, and CMTP with recruiting and maintaining expert technical working \ngroups, stakehalders,\nadvisory groups, and Delphi panels for multiple projects, we are confident in \nour ability to recruit high-\nquality participants for this panel. We have obtained letters of support from \nWGS technology and\ninformatics companies, and two provider groups. The buy-in of these \norganizations, aur interviews with\nindustry leaders in Aim 1, our dissemination of the landscape analysis to \npolicymakers (Aim 3),and the\npresence of industry and thought leaders on the advisory panel will all serve as  \ncatalysts for additional\nrecruitment. ]]\nPreparation of the Delphi Panel and Delphi Materials: Maintaining panel \nmembersâ  anonymity in their \nSurvey responses encourages unconventional or unexpected ideas and questions.*Â°  \nHence, each panel\nmember will be assigned a two letter code that panel members and study staff \nwill use to refer to each\nother during the surveys.â * However, complete anonymity can undermine the \nprocess; participants need\nconfidence that their fellow participants are respected peers. A brief group \nbuilding exercise will be\nconducted at the outset to develop this confidence. Panel members will be asked \nto submit their names,\n\n--- Page 14 ---\naffiliations, and areas of expertise, as well as their concerns and hopes for \nthe Delphi process. A summary\nof this information will be disseminated to all participants. Panel members will  \nalso be sent the landscape\nanalysis from Aim 1, which will provide important context for the identification  \nand consideration of policy\nquestions. The initial surveys for both problem identification and the \ndevelopment of policy approaches will\nbe carefully developed ahead of time by staff and piloted with advisory board \nmembers. Instruments for the\nlater rounds will be determined by the panel responses.\nIdentification and prioritization of novel policy questions posed by WGS: The \nstakeholder panel and project\nStaff will engage in two rounds of input to clearly identify and prioritize \nunique policy questions related to the\nclinical use of WGS. Prior to the first round of the Delphi process, the entire \nstudy team, in consultation with\nthe advisory board, will use our landscape analysis and our knowledge of current  \nstandards and policy to\ndevelop a preliminary list of novel policy questions we believe are raised by \nclinical WGS. This â straw \nmodelâ  of policy questions will be submitted to panel members for \nconsideration as the first survey.\nParticipants will be asked to review the issues, add issues, comment on any \nissues they wish, and rate the\nimportance, validity, and technical and political feasibility of addressing each  \nissue using 5-point Likert\nscales.â \"' The use of these scales does not exclude other forms of \nclassification of the policy questions;\nwe will consider the findings of our landscape analysis and recommendations of \nthe advisory panel to\nidentify other measures by which these questions might be categorized.\nThe team will assess and summarize the responses. The resulting annotated list \nof policy questions will be\npresented back to the panel, who will use a second online survey to review the \nissues, make additional\ncomments, and again rate the importance, validity, and technical and political \nfeasibility of addressing each\nissue. The feedback will be summarized to produce an annotated list of policy \nquestions. The questions will\nbe prioritized using the ranked scale data. Numerical values for importance and \nvalidity will be summed to\nform a \"Priority\" scale ranging from 0 to 8, while values for technical \nfeasibility will be summed to form a\n\"Tractabilityâ  scale ranging from 0 to 8. An Overall scale summing all four \nitems (range 0-16) will also be\ntallied. Median values for the individual and combined scales will be calculated  \nfor each policy question.\nNumerical priority rankings will be computed after sorting the list of questions  \nby median Overall rating, then\nPriority. A second list of ratings will be computed, sorting by Overall rating \nfollowed by Tractability. An\nannotated, ranked, sortable list of priorities with median values of each \ncomposite and individual scale will\nbe published and disseminated in a variety of formats to the broader stakeholder  \ncommunities to inform the\ndevelopment of WGS-related policy.\nResearch Strategy Page 109\n============================================================\nPage 10\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nDevelopment of multiple policy approaches to address the most pressing, \ntractable issues in our areas of\nexpertise: The goal of generating policy approaches is to provide policymakers \nand others with several\nalternatives to address policy needs for the effective integration of WGS. \nIdeally, alternative approaches vary in\nterms of timing, mechanism, distribution of burden, extent of federal and state \ngovernment involvement, and\nstakeholder support. The second round of the Delphi process will be used to \ndevelop approaches that might\nnot have emerged from a less structured stakeholder conversation that could be \nled or dominated by members\nwith particular viewpoints. The process will also provide a detailed \nunderstanding of where various factions\nconverge and diverge, and the nature of disagreements. These data help to \nidentify aspects of policy that will\nrequire negotiation and compromise.\nSelection of the policy questions to address: We have organized a team with \nexpertise in three policy areas\nidentified by the program announcement as important to the success of clinical \nWGS - analytic validity and\ntesting quality (GPPC), patenting and licensing (Duke}, and reimbursement and \npayment (CMTP}. We will\naddress the most important, tractable issue identified by the panel in each of \nthese three categories. We\nrecognize that the panel will identity several important issues that lie outside  \nof these domains, and we will\nencourage others with appropriate expertise to take up the development of \npolicies to address them. We\nwill consult the advisory board on our choice of issues.\nAnalysis of the current legal and requlatory framework surrounding the three \nselected issues: Each policy\ngroup (GPP, Duke, and GMPT) will prepare an initial evaluation of the current \nfederal and state laws and\nregulations, [[professional and association guidelines, and standards being \nadopted by the WGSj] industry that\napply to the issues being addressed. We will consider the intended purpose of \nthese rules, whether they are\nboth broad and precise enough to address the policy issues being considered. We \nalso will examine whether\nand by whom compliance with existing laws is enforced. Finally, we will \ndetermine whether there are conflicts\nor redundancies between different Jaws and guidelines that may need to be \nresolved. These analyses will be\nwritten up into white papers and disseminated to pane] members to provide them \nwith context for the\ndevelopment of policy approaches. Drs. McGuire and Kaufman will coordinate the \nefforts of the three teams\nfo ensure that they produce comparable evaluations that can be combined and \nexamined together.\nThroughout the study, regular project meetings involving all key staff will be \nconducted to ensure timely\nprogress, as well as comparable goals and products among the different teams.\nDevelopment a range of potential policy approaches: To begin developing policy \nalternatives, Delphi panel\nmembers will be asked to â brainstormâ  in response to the third survey  \nconsisting of open-ended questions\nabout how best to address the three policy issues. Panelists will be asked to \nconsider the landscape of the\nindustry and the current policy environment as well as more specific outcomes \nsuch as the impact on public\nhealth, cost implications for the government and stakeholders, and the impact on  \naccess to WGS and other\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nservices. Additional criteria for consideration may also be identified. The \nproject team will simultaneously\nouiline its own policy approaches using the policy analysis framework developed \nby Patton & Sawicki.*?\nCombining stakeholder input with the project teamâ s approaches, we will \nprepare a straw model of policy\nalternatives to address each issue. Following the policy Delphi approach of,â *  \nthe straw model will take the\nform of a series of resolutions and arguments supporting each resolution. In \nsurvey four, participants will\nrank the desirability and feasibility of each resolution, and the importance and  \nvalidity of each supporting\nargument. Panel members may add resolutions and propose supporting or opposing \narguments for\nresolutions. The staff will \"moderateâ  the discussion by feeding mean and \nmedian rankings, comments and\nsuggestions back to panel members for a final survey to collect rankings and \nfeedback. The staff will\ncambine and summarize comments in the case of identical arguments.\nBefore disseminating the policy approaches more broadly, we will review our \nfindings at an in-person\nmeeting of the Delphi panel members and project staff.

I will now assess the likelihood of this project having a powerful, sustained influence on its field.\n\n## Assessment of Project's Potential for Sustained Impact\n\n### **Likelihood of Sustained, Powerful Influence: HIGH**\n\nThis project is positioned to exert substantial and lasting influence on the emerging field of clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) policy. The timing is optimal - capturing a critical inflection point as WGS transitions from research to clinical application while regulatory frameworks remain underdeveloped.\n\n### **Major Strengths Increasing Overall Impact:**\n\n1. **Critical Timing and First-Mover Advantage**\n   - Addresses policy vacuum at the precise moment WGS enters clinical practice (costs dropped 1,000-fold in 5 years)\n   - First systematic U.S.-centered landscape analysis of WGS industry\n   - Potential to shape early regulatory approaches before practices become entrenched\n\n2. **Methodological Rigor and Innovation**\n   - Modified Delphi process ensures systematic stakeholder input from 40 diverse experts\n   - Structured approach to prioritizing policy issues based on importance and tractability\n   - Creates replicable framework for future genomic technology policy development\n\n3. **Exceptional Investigator Team**\n   - Co-PIs with complementary expertise (Kaufman: genetics policy; McGuire: law/bioethics)\n   - Domain experts covering all three focus areas (Javitt: FDA/CLIA; Cook-Deegan: patents; Tunis: reimbursement)\n   - Advisory board includes industry pioneers (Church, Rothberg), legal scholars, and policy experts\n\n4. **Direct Policy Translation Pathway**\n   - Concrete dissemination plan targeting federal policymakers\n   - Washington briefings, Congressional meetings, and targeted outreach\n   - Partnership with Burness Communications for professional dissemination\n\n5. **Comprehensive Scope with Focused Outputs**\n   - Addresses three critical domains simultaneously: quality oversight, intellectual property, reimbursement\n   - Produces actionable deliverables: prioritized policy questions, specific approaches for top issues\n   - Creates authoritative stakeholder-validated recommendations\n\n### **Potential Weaknesses Limiting Long-Term Influence:**\n\n1. **Technology Volatility Risk**\n   - WGS technology advancing rapidly; some recommendations may become obsolete\n   - No built-in mechanism for updating findings as industry evolves\n   - 24-month timeline may be too long given pace of change\n\n2. **Implementation Gap**\n   - Project generates recommendations but lacks enforcement mechanisms\n   - Success depends on external actors (FDA, CMS, Congress) adopting proposals\n   - No formal partnerships with regulatory agencies to ensure uptake\n\n3. **Limited Scope Coverage**\n   - Focuses on three domains; excludes privacy, data storage, equity issues\n   - May miss emergent policy challenges not anticipated at project start\n   - Reliance on 40-member panel may not capture full stakeholder diversity\n\n4. **Methodological Constraints**\n   - Delphi process depends on sustained participant engagement over 20 months\n   - Consensus-building may dilute bold recommendations\n   - Industry interviews limited to 20 leaders; may miss disruptive new entrants\n\n5. **Sustainability Concerns**\n   - No clear plan for maintaining policy framework beyond grant period\n   - Landscape analysis will quickly become outdated without ongoing updates\n   - No institutional commitment to continue work post-funding\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe project's strengths substantially outweigh its weaknesses. The combination of optimal timing, methodological innovation, exceptional expertise, and direct policy channels positions this work to become the foundational framework for WGS regulation. The systematic stakeholder engagement approach and focus on tractable, high-priority issues increases likelihood of real-world implementation. While technology evolution and implementation challenges pose risks, the project's design as an early, authoritative intervention in an emerging field maximizes its potential for lasting influence. The creation of a replicable policy development framework extends impact beyond immediate deliverables.\n\n**Recommendation: This project merits strong support as it addresses a critical need at a pivotal moment with appropriate methods and exceptional personnel.**",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_claude_opus4, AI assistant. Based on my review of the \"Policy Planning for Whole Genome Sequencing\" proposal, here is my assessment:\n\n**Assessment of Project's Likelihood for Powerful, Sustained Influence**\n\n**Overall Assessment:** This project has high potential for sustained, powerful influence on WGS policy development, meriting an Overall Impact Score of 2.\n\n**Major Strengths Increasing Potential Impact:**\n\n1. **Critical Timing and First-Mover Advantage:** The proposal addresses policy needs precisely as WGS costs have dropped 1,000-fold and clinical applications are emerging. Being among the first systematic policy frameworks positions it to shape early implementation standards before practices become entrenched.\n\n2. **Exceptional Multi-Domain Expertise:** The team combines leading experts across FDA/CLIA regulation (Javitt), intellectual property (Cook-Deegan), reimbursement policy (Tunis), and bioethics (McGuire/Kaufman). This breadth ensures comprehensive policy coverage rarely achievable in single-investigator studies.\n\n3. **Innovative Stakeholder Engagement Methodology:** The modified Delphi approach with 40 diverse stakeholders across five surveys plus in-person summit represents methodological innovation that could become a model for future genomic policy development.\n\n4. **Direct Policy Translation Pathway:** Partnership with Burness Communications and planned briefings to federal officials, Congressional staff, and agency leaders creates immediate pathways from research findings to policy action.\n\n5. **Industry-Informed Foundation:** The landscape analysis combining web research with 20 industry leader interviews ensures policy recommendations reflect real-world implementation challenges rather than theoretical concerns.\n\n**Key Weaknesses That Could Limit Long-Term Influence:**\n\n1. **Narrow Scope to Three Domains:** While the proposal acknowledges other critical areas (privacy, data storage, equity), limiting deep analysis to quality oversight, patents, and reimbursement may reduce comprehensive impact as other issues emerge.\n\n2. **Stakeholder Dependency Risk:** Success hinges on sustained engagement of 40 high-level stakeholders over 20 months. The proposal lacks detailed contingency plans for panel attrition or declining participation quality.\n\n3. **Rapid Technology Evolution:** WGS technology and business models are evolving rapidly. The 24-month timeline may result in some findings becoming outdated before dissemination, though the forward-looking industry interviews partially mitigate this risk.\n\n4. **Implementation Gap:** While the proposal excels at policy development and dissemination, it lacks mechanisms to track or ensure policy adoption by regulatory agencies or legislative bodies.\n\n5. **Limited Quantitative Framework:** The Delphi process relies heavily on expert opinion without complementary quantitative modeling of policy impacts on access, costs, or health outcomes.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThis project is positioned to become a foundational reference for WGS policy development, with exceptional likelihood of shaping early regulatory approaches. The combination of timely execution, comprehensive expertise, and innovative stakeholder engagement methodology creates strong potential for field-defining impact. However, sustained influence will require subsequent efforts to broaden domain coverage, track implementation outcomes, and update recommendations as the technology evolves. The project's greatest strength—capturing diverse stakeholder perspectives at a critical juncture—also represents its primary execution risk.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\n**Assessment of Likelihood for Powerful, Sustained Influence**\n\n**Likelihood of Powerful, Sustained Influence:**  \nThe likelihood that this project will have a powerful and enduring influence on the field of genomic medicine policy is high. The proposal targets foundational regulatory and policy needs at the critical juncture of whole genome sequencing's (WGS) integration into clinical care—a juncture where effective policy frameworks are lacking and where timely, systematic guidance could shape the landscape for years. By engaging a diverse constellation of stakeholders in real time and structuring policy responses to pressing issues, the project is exceptionally well positioned to generate reference points and best practices for regulators, payers, industry, and healthcare providers.\n\n**Major Strengths Increasing Overall Impact:**\n\n1. **Timeliness and Field Centrality:**  \n   The project addresses urgent, recognized gaps as WGS rapidly becomes clinically relevant, aligning with national priorities and filling a policy void that directly impacts patient care, reimbursement, and healthcare innovation.\n\n2. **Methodological Innovation and Inclusiveness:**  \n   By employing a modified Delphi process, the project brings systematic, iterative, and anonymous input from a uniquely broad range of stakeholders—including industry, government, payers, clinicians, and ethicists—ensuring any recommendations are robust, practical, and broadly credible.\n\n3. **Breadth and Depth of Expertise:**  \n   The investigative team and advisory board are comprised of leading figures in genetics, law, policy, reimbursement, and bioethics, with a proven record of producing impactful policy analysis and successfully engaging diverse expert communities.\n\n4. **Proactive and Targeted Dissemination:**  \n   The proposal’s strong plan for dissemination through white papers, briefings, and dialogue with policy actors increases the probability that the outputs will reach and inform the key decision-makers necessary for broad, sustained impact.\n\n**Weaknesses That Could Limit Long-Term Influence or Feasibility:**\n\n1. **Stakeholder Engagement Risks:**  \n   The project’s success depends on continued, high-level engagement from a broad group of sectoral experts. Factors such as stakeholder attrition, disengagement, or bias could undermine the breadth and credibility of resulting recommendations.\n\n2. **Rapidly Evolving Technological and Policy Landscape:**  \n   The genomics field changes quickly; regulatory needs, market pressures, or technological advances may outpace or shift beyond the project's focal areas by project completion, necessitating ongoing updates to keep outputs relevant.\n\n3. **Project Scope and Generalizability:**  \n   Although strong in its three core domains (quality, reimbursement, IP), the project necessarily leaves out other areas of emerging importance (e.g., privacy protections, data sharing, global harmonization). This narrowing could limit the generalizability and long-term comprehensiveness of the project’s policy guidance.\n\n4. **Implementation and Uptake:**  \n   The project’s main outputs are recommendations and policy options, not enforceable policy changes—translation into actual regulatory or payer actions will depend on outside actors, which introduces uncertainty and potential delay.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis project’s strong rationale, innovative methods, expert team, and engagement strategy provide an excellent platform for a lasting, field-shaping contribution to clinical genomics policy and practice. While the inherent risks of a rapidly evolving stakeholder and regulatory environment, potential engagement attrition, and the limits of recommending (rather than enacting) policy are real, the design anticipates and partially mitigates these obstacles. Overall, the probability of powerful, sustained influence is high, especially within U.S. policy and regulatory circles at a formative period for genomic medicine.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

This will include the generation, delivery, and interpretation of genomic data, utilizing literature reviews, online resources, company materials, and interviews with up to 20 industry leaders. This forms the foundation for identifying and addressing related policy challenges.\n\n2. **Aim 2: Identify, Prioritize, and Address Policy Questions via a Modified Delphi Process**\n   - Using findings from the landscape analysis, the investigators will generate and iteratively refine a list of unique, tractable policy questions about clinical WGS—focusing particularly on test quality and services, patenting and licensing, and insurance coverage/reimbursement. A diverse stakeholder panel (~40 members) will prioritize these issues in terms of importance and tractability. The team will then work with panelists to develop, analyze, and refine policy approaches addressing three high-priority questions (one in each domain), culminating in recommendations and a report applicable to a broader range of WGS policy concerns.\n\n3. **Aim 3: Disseminate Findings to Policymakers and Stakeholders**\n   - The project will proactively communicate its analyses and recommendations—in accessible forms such as white papers, briefs, and webcasts—targeting a broad spectrum of stakeholders (e.g., government, industry, payers, and patient organizations). Public briefings and follow-up policymaker meetings are planned to spur evidence-based dialogue and implementation.\n\n**Central Hypothesis:**\n\nThe proposal hypothesizes that **systematic, real-time engagement of a diverse spectrum of stakeholders, using structured consensus methods and current industry mapping, will reveal actionable, high-priority policy challenges and practical solutions for integrating WGS into clinical care**. Existing regulatory, reimbursement, and intellectual property frameworks are inadequate for WGS; by directly involving those developing, regulating, or using clinical genomics, the project can identify and address the most urgent issues before policy gaps constrain patient benefit, access, or innovation.\n\nIf you would like further detail on any single aim or methodological element, or a more condensed summary, please let me know.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment of the Project’s Likelihood for Powerful, Sustained Influence**\n\n**Likelihood of Powerful, Sustained Influence:**  \nThis project is highly likely to exert a strong, lasting impact on the field of genomics policy and the clinical adoption of whole genome sequencing (WGS). It addresses an urgent, foundational policy gap at the moment when WGS is transitioning rapidly into routine clinical practice. By proactively structuring the national conversation and supporting evidence-based policy development, the project can shape regulatory approaches, reimbursement, and intellectual property standards that will influence the uptake and societal value of WGS for many years.\n\n---\n\n**Major Strengths That Enhance Potential Impact:**\n\n1. **Timeliness and Field Alignment:**  \n   - The proposal intervenes precisely as clinical WGS adoption outpaces existing regulatory frameworks. It is directly responsive to stated priorities of NHGRI and other federal agencies, positioning it as essential infrastructure for policy development.\n   \n2. **Methodological Innovation and Breadth:**  \n   - The modified Delphi approach ensures broad, structured engagement with sector-spanning stakeholders, capturing nuanced, real-world perspectives that elevate both the legitimacy and applicability of recommendations.\n   - The systematic, iterative methods anticipate changing policy needs and bring transparency and reproducibility to a typically opaque policy-setting process.\n\n3. **Influential Expertise and Access:**  \n   - The investigative team and advisory board bring recognized expertise and strong networks in genomics, law, regulatory science, reimbursement, and technology assessment. Their leadership history in national and NIH-backed policy initiatives increases credibility and the likelihood that outputs will be considered authoritative.\n\n4. **Concrete Focus and Targeted Dissemination:**  \n   - By focusing on high-value policy domains (test quality, reimbursement, and IP), the project is positioned to create actionable, high-uptake recommendations, rather than diffuse or superficial outputs.\n   - The planned multi-format dissemination—white papers, webcasts, congressional briefings, direct stakeholder engagement—maximizes the reach and real-world resonance of findings.\n\n---\n\n**Weaknesses or Risks that Could Limit Sustained Impact:**\n\n1. **Dependence on Ongoing Stakeholder Engagement:**  \n   - The project’s outcomes hinge on active, diverse participation throughout a multi-round process. Stakeholder fatigue, attrition, or dominance by certain interests could compromise the consensus, generalizability, or practical uptake of recommendations.\n\n2. **Rapidly Changing Technological and Policy Landscapes:**  \n   - While the project is explicitly real-time and adaptable, WGS and related policies may evolve faster than project cycles or dissemination can fully keep pace—potentially rendering some recommendations less timely or missing emerging issues.\n\n3. **Scope and Transferability:**  \n   - The domain focus (test quality, IP, reimbursement) is well justified but does exclude critical adjacent topics such as privacy, data sharing, global regulatory harmonization, and secondary findings—limiting the comprehensiveness or enduring relevance of the report as the field grows.\n\n4. **From Recommendations to Change:**  \n   - The project produces policy options, not binding regulatory or legislative reform. Actual adoption/implementation will depend on external decision-makers, and inertia in regulatory or payer agencies could delay or dilute real-world impact, regardless of the quality of the recommendations.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis:**  \nThe strengths in timing, methodological design, team expertise, and realistic dissemination channels together provide a strong platform for shaping both near-term and lasting policy environments in clinical genomics. The major risks are mostly those inherent to any policy-development or consensus-driven project—illuminated, but not entirely solved, by the team’s mitigation strategies. Ensuring sustained influence will likely require periodic revisiting and updating of recommendations as the landscape continues to shift.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

It lacks the required structure, scoring system, and evidence-based evaluation expected in scientific grant review. The analysis is superficial, promotional rather than critical, and missing essential components of rigorous peer review. The response reads as advocacy rather than objective scientific evaluation. To be acceptable, it must be completely rewritten using the NIH review template, include all numeric scores with detailed justifications, and provide critical assessment grounded in specific proposal content.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nBelow is an NIH-style peer review addressing the likelihood of a powerful, sustained influence, including major strengths and weaknesses, using the required NIH scoring, structure, and explicit evidence-based evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Inferred: Policy Development for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)]  \n**PI:** [Inferred: David Kaufman, Amy McGuire]  \n**Mechanism:** [Inferred: R01]\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe proposal identifies an urgent national need for policy frameworks supporting the clinical integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS). The current regulatory and reimbursement environment is ill-suited to the complexity and scale of WGS, risking inequitable access, uncertainty in test quality, and unclear use of results. The project’s focus on policy development specifically for WGS—and its direct response to the NHGRI ELSI program announcement—ensures high programmatic importance. Conceptual innovation is strong: the project goes beyond theoretical discussion to convene a broad, multi-sector expert panel in real time, addressing three domains (quality, reimbursement, intellectual property) widely recognized as bottlenecks for the field’s progress. This foundational, cross-disciplinary work has clear potential to advance knowledge and influence policy adoption at a critical inflection point in clinical genomics.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe project is methodologically rigorous, combining a systematic industry landscape analysis and up to 20 semi-structured interviews with a robust, modified Delphi process (n=40) for consensus building among diverse stakeholders (industry, payers, clinicians, policymakers). The team addresses recruitment, engagement, and confidentiality in detail, mitigating common risks of panel-based policy research. The timeline and scope (five online surveys over 20 months, in-person summit) are realistic and appropriate for the complexity. The inclusion of industry support, an expert advisory board, and strategies for minimizing attrition strengthen feasibility. However, there are inherent risks of selection or response bias, panel fatigue, and limitations due to focusing only on three domains when other urgent issues (e.g., privacy, global policy harmonization) exist. While these are partly addressed (e.g., with updating processes and efforts to recruit high-quality participants), the proposal could be more explicit about how findings will remain current as the field rapidly evolves.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe PI team, advisory board, and collaborators are demonstrably experienced in genomics policy, regulatory science, law, data analysis, and multi-stakeholder engagement. Their history of NIH-funded work and leadership in national policy forums is well documented; no expertise or resource gaps are apparent. Institutional and IT/data infrastructure is sound and appropriate for the study’s demands.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA\n\n- **Human Subjects:** The only human research involves expert interviewees and panelists; privacy protections, de-identification, and IRB protocols are referenced.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not specified.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** Applies qualitative analysis best practices (NVivo, audio recording, verified panel data). No biologicals or technical reagents involved.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:** Not detailed, but the 20-month plan and team structure are well matched to typical R01 levels.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe project is poised for a powerful and sustained impact on the field of genomic medicine policy. Its strengths—timely focus, broad stakeholder engagement, robust and innovative methodology, and a team of recognized leaders—provide an excellent platform for authoritative, actionable recommendations at a pivotal stage of WGS’s clinical rollout. The proposal’s dissemination strategy (briefings, white papers, webcasts) is tailored for maximal influence among regulators, payers, and industry. Potential weaknesses include the risk of stakeholder disengagement, the challenge of keeping outputs current amidst rapid field developments, and the deliberate limitation to three policy domains (with less immediate impact on issues like privacy or international harmonization). However, these are likely offset by mitigation plans (panel support/refreshment, regular landscape analysis) and a clear path to the field’s most urgent, actionable priorities. While adoption of recommendations by external decision-makers is inherently uncertain, the project's products are likely to set enduring benchmarks for policy discourse and regulatory action in clinical genomics.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Major Strengths:**\n- Responds to a critical, timely public health and policy need;\n- Introduces systematic, innovative, and inclusive policy development methodology with demonstrated feasibility;\n- Led by a highly qualified team with multi-level expertise and national reach;\n- Focuses on domains of high practical significance for near-term and sustained systemic influence.\n\n**Key Weaknesses:**\n- Success relies on sustained, diverse stakeholder engagement and may be vulnerable to panel attrition or evolving composition;\n- Does not directly address emergent issues outside its three domains;\n- Uncertainty about how recommendations will translate into enacted policy, though dissemination efforts are strong.\n\n**Overall, the project’s strengths decisively outweigh these risks, supporting a very high likelihood of lasting, field-shaping influence.**\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Structural Compliance Issues:**\n- Uses correct factor headings but deviates from required format\n- Missing explicit step-by-step evaluation process specified in the framework\n- Lacks systematic assessment of each criterion within factors\n- Additional Review Criteria sections are superficial and incomplete\n\n**2. Scoring Inconsistencies and Lack of Evidence:**\n- Awards exceptionally high scores (2s and 3) but justifications lack specific evidence from proposal\n- No direct quotes or page references to support claims\n- Vague assertions like \"urgently recognized national need\" without citing specific proposal text\n- Claims about \"demonstrably experienced\" team without referencing specific accomplishments listed in proposal\n\n**3. Critical Omissions in Factor 2 (Rigor):**\n- No evaluation of statistical power or sample size justification for n=40\n- Fails to assess specific feasibility concerns raised in proposal (e.g., stakeholder recruitment challenges)\n- No discussion of how three policy domains were selected from larger set\n- Missing evaluation of interview methodology rigor (only 20 interviews from ~40 companies)\n\n**4. Superficial Treatment of Weaknesses:**\n- Acknowledges \"inherent risks\" but doesn't critically evaluate them\n- States proposal \"could be more explicit\" about currency but doesn't dock points appropriately\n- Notes limitation to three domains but doesn't reconcile with claims of comprehensive impact\n- Minimizes implementation uncertainty despite lack of enforcement mechanisms\n\n**5. Logical Inconsistencies:**\n- Awards Factor 2 score of 3 (excellent) while identifying multiple methodological concerns\n- Claims \"no expertise gaps\" but doesn't evaluate missing domains (privacy, equity, data security)\n- States weaknesses are \"likely offset\" without evidence these mitigation strategies will work\n- Overall Impact Score of 2 seems inflated given identified limitations\n\n**6. Missing Critical Assessments:**\n- No evaluation of preliminary data or pilot work\n- Doesn't assess whether modified Delphi is appropriate for policy development vs. consensus building\n- No consideration of potential conflicts of interest with industry stakeholders\n- Fails to evaluate dissemination plan effectiveness beyond listing activities\n\n**7. Inadequate Innovation Assessment:**\n- Factor 1 briefly mentions \"conceptual innovation\" but doesn't evaluate against NIH innovation criteria\n- No assessment of whether approach truly advances field methodologically\n- Missing evaluation of how this differs from previous policy efforts\n\n**Summary:**\nWhile this response attempts to follow NIH structure, it remains insufficiently rigorous. The high scores appear unjustified given the superficial evidence provided and multiple acknowledged weaknesses. The review reads as overly positive, lacking the critical, balanced analysis expected in NIH peer review. To meet standards, the response needs specific proposal citations, more careful score calibration, deeper methodological critique, and honest assessment of limitations' impact on overall feasibility and influence.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nBelow is an NIH-style analysis, employing the required structure, scoring, and explicit, evidence-based evaluation of problem importance and the project’s potential to advance knowledge or health.\n\n---\n\n**FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)**\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe problem is highly important and exceptionally well-framed for advancing both knowledge and health in clinical genomics. The proposal addresses a critical, timely gap: as whole genome sequencing (WGS) is rapidly becoming feasible and affordable for clinical use, no comprehensive or modern policy framework exists to ensure quality, access, and responsible clinical integration. The current regulatory environment—developed for single-gene testing and newborn screening—is explicitly identified as inadequate for the scale, complexity, and data stewardship challenges unique to WGS. The project’s direct engagement with urgent regulatory, reimbursement, and intellectual property issues reflects alignment with current NIH and NHGRI priorities, as referenced in program announcements and recent advances (e.g., dropping sequencing costs, insurance coverage, increasing diagnostic use). The approach moves beyond theory, proposing a real-time, multi-stakeholder process to identify and prioritize policy needs, which is novel and field-leading for genomics policy studies.\n\n**Strengths in Problem Framing:**\n- **Clarity and Urgency:** The proposal persuasively outlines the risk that, without timely, evidence-based policy, the clinical utility and equitable adoption of WGS may be compromised. Examples (e.g., policy inaction, payer uncertainty, fragmented oversight) make the stakes tangible.\n- **Relevance to Public Health and National Priorities:** Explicit ties to the NHGRI ELSI announcement and recognition of WGS’s potential for broad, population-level impact underscore national importance.\n- **Specificity of Challenges:** Frames the problem not generically, but by naming key domains—test quality, reimbursement, IP—whose complexity and interdependence are well articulated as uniquely challenging in the WGS era.\n- **Forward-Looking, Inclusive Framing:** Recognition that policy development must preempt “patchwork” responses as WGS enters the clinic, aiming to avoid repeating early mistakes from from DTC genetic testing and single-gene regulation.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses in Rationale or Evidence:**\n- **Quantitative Context Lacking:** The proposal’s rationale could be further strengthened by including more quantitative evidence (e.g., rates of WGS growth, specific clinical or reimbursement failures, or direct comparisons of the regulatory gap’s effects on health outcomes across states or systems).\n- **Breadth vs. Depth Limitation:** While the focus on three core domains is practical, the rationale for deprioritizing related concerns (privacy, equity, global harmonization) is described but could be justified with more direct evidence or acknowledgment of potential downstream impact.\n- **Unmet Potential for Comparative Policy Analysis:** The proposal could gain strength by referencing, or contrasting with, approaches taken in other rapidly evolving health technology fields, reinforcing WGS policy urgency by analogy.\n\n---\n\n**Will the Project Advance Knowledge or Health?**  \nYes. The project’s approach—systematic mapping of stakeholders and challenges, prioritized consensus building, and actionable recommendations—will directly expand foundational knowledge of the barriers to evidence-based WGS integration in healthcare. By targeting regulatory bottlenecks and supporting policy standardization, the project is likely to indirectly advance public health outcomes through safer, more equitable, and more effective implementation of genomic medicine. The findings will provide reference points for policymakers, professionals, and payers at a national level.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe proposal defines a problem of central, urgent significance to genomic medicine and health policy, framed with clarity, specificity, and innovative vision. While incorporation of additional quantitative data and justification for the exclusion of some domains would further strengthen its importance rationale, the overall presentation convincingly supports a high-impact research agenda, poised to advance both knowledge and, ultimately, public health.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Below, I address the major points of feedback before presenting a fully NIH-standard, comprehensive review as requested.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection on Critique:**\n\n- **Validity:**  \n  The critique correctly notes that my prior response delivered an in-depth evaluation only of Factor 1 (Importance) and did not fully adhere to NIH requirements by omitting explicit evaluation of Rigor and Feasibility (Factor 2), Expertise and Resources (Factor 3), Additional Review Criteria, and an Overall Impact Score. These omissions represent a procedural gap that is essential in standard NIH reviews.\n\n- **Comprehensiveness:**  \n  The prior response could indeed appear as a partial answer to the prompt, lacking overall synthesis and broader discussion of feasibility, long-term influence, and implementation sustainability.\n\n- **Analytic Precision:**  \n  While extensive, some narrative sections could be more concise, and critical discussion of methodological choices, sustainability, and resource sufficiency were properly requested but not fully addressed.\n\n- **Disagreement:**  \n  The critique’s call for exclusive focus on conciseness over nuance must be balanced; NIH reviews should be both precise and sufficiently explanatory to justify scores—particularly for complex or innovative policy research. I do not, however, dispute the need for comprehensive structural adherence.\n\n---\n\n**Regenerated NIH-Style Review: Importance, Advancement of Knowledge/Health, and Potential for Powerful, Sustained Influence**\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Inferred: Policy Development for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)]  \n**PI:** [Inferred: David Kaufman, Amy McGuire]  \n**Mechanism:** [Inferred: R01]\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe proposal addresses a major national and scientific need—the lack of coherent policy frameworks to guide WGS clinical integration as costs fall and use in patient care accelerates. The current regulatory landscape, built for single-gene testing, is demonstrably outpaced by technological change, risking gaps in quality, reimbursement, and equitable access. The project’s aims map precisely onto highly consequential domains (test quality, reimbursement, IP), and its proactive, consensus-driven methodology gives it field-defining potential. The rationale is convincing, with clear alignment to NHGRI and federal priorities. However, the integration of more quantitative data and deeper comparative analysis to bolster the urgency and universality of the policy gap could slightly strengthen the case.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe approach integrates a rigorous multi-phase methodology: systematic industry mapping, targeted industry leader interviews (n=20), and a structured, multi-round, modified Delphi process (n=40) engaging multi-sector stakeholders. Recruitment and engagement strategies are detailed and build on the team’s successful track record with comparable panels. Timeline (20 months for Delphi) and resource allocation align with study aims. The iterative, consensus-building process is suited to the rapid evolution of the domain. Risks include possible stakeholder attrition, limited panel representativeness, and the challenge of maintaining up-to-date recommendations given the pace of technological change. While mitigation strategies (active monitoring, advisory board input, letters of support) are described, further detail about maintaining relevance and sustaining engagement beyond project funding would strengthen feasibility.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe PI, co-I’s, and advisory board collectively possess recognized expertise in genomics policy, reimbursement, law, consensus methodology, and stakeholder engagement. The leadership team has a record of successful large, NIH-funded policy projects. Institutional support and data management resources are well described; infrastructure for both quantitative and qualitative research is in place.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA\n\n- **Human Subjects:**  \n  Involves only expert panelists/interviewees; robust privacy/confidentiality processes are specified.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:**  \n  Not specified.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n  Methodologically sound approaches are described for qualitative and survey research; no scientific reagents.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:**  \n  No budget included in the excerpt; timeline and personnel appropriate for standard R01.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe project is poised for major, sustained influence on the policy, regulatory, and health system environment for clinical WGS. Major strengths include high significance, a robust and innovative stakeholder engagement model, alignment with evolving clinical and policy needs, a team of preeminent experts, and a clear and proactive plan for dissemination. Weaknesses, such as limited attention to long-term updating and sustainability beyond the grant period, potential stakeholder disengagement, and a focus on only three policy domains, are recognized but do not undermine the overall likelihood that the project will produce lasting, actionable benchmarks for U.S. WGS policy. The project’s structured methodology and national engagement are likely to advance both policy knowledge and real-world health outcomes through improved regulatory clarity, test quality, and reimbursement standards.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Major Strengths:**\n- Clear, urgent, and consequential problem identification\n- Strongly justified aims targeting test quality, reimbursement, and IP\n- Innovative consensus-driven methodology with demonstrated engagement success\n- Highly qualified team and advisors, broad sectoral reach\n- Proactive and multi-modal dissemination strategy targeting policy actors\n\n**Key Weaknesses:**\n- Project influence may be circumscribed by panel composition and attrition risks\n- Focus on three domains; less immediate coverage of privacy or global policy\n- Long-term updating or policy maintenance beyond the funding period not fully specified\n\n**Overall, the balance of strengths provides a compelling rationale for high sustained impact and importance.**\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

      "content": "The other agent (NIH_gpt_4.1) provided the following response. Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nThank you to NIH_claude_opus4 for the thorough critique. I have reflected on each observation and below, I address valid concerns, noting where I agree and where further clarification is necessary, before providing a revised, fully-compliant NIH review that more rigorously weighs strengths against limitations and grounds statements in explicit proposal evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection on Critique**\n\n1. **Header and Identification Issues:**  \nI agree: the proposal lists David Kaufman and Amy McGuire as PIs, and the use of \"inferred\" is unnecessarily vague; the mechanism, though not labeled in all excerpts, can reasonably be identified as R01 based on aims, scale, and context.\n\n2. **Score Justifications and Use of Evidence:**  \nPoint taken—using direct examples from the proposal (such as the cited cost reduction, FDA public meetings, and specific gaps in current policy) would strengthen justification for scoring and provide context beyond subjective phrases like \"field-defining.\" \n\n3. **Methodological Assessment (Factor 2):**  \nValid critique. The rationale for a 40-member Delphi panel, the selection process for industry interviews, statistical ranking/plans for policy prioritization, and the rigor of the landscape analysis are all explicitly described in the proposal and should be summarized and critiqued in the review. Risks of bias and attrition, justification for five surveys, and strengths/weaknesses of these methodological decisions require more critical discussion.\n\n4. **Additional Criteria and Human Subjects:**  \nAgree. The human subjects section should specify requirements for IRB review even when using experts and address informed consent practices. Budget and personnel assessments should be tied to described activities rather than generalized assumptions.\n\n5. **Overall Impact and Weighting of Limitations:**  \nFair: the overall impact score must explicitly integrate all strengths and weaknesses. If the project leaves out major policy domains, this should be presented as a substantive limitation that tempers predicted impact, rather than dismissed as minor.\n\n6. **Other Missing Elements:**  \nPoints about preliminary data, adequacy of timeline, pilot work, plans for dissemination effectiveness, and detailed sustainability strategy are valid and reflect critical NIH peer review expectations.\n\n7. **Logical Flow:**  \nIt is important to avoid “score inflation” and ensure that each weakness and risk clearly informs the impact assessment; strengths should not be overstated in light of credible, unaddressed limitations.\n\n**Where I Disagree:**  \nOn minor points, such as the necessity of line-by-line proposal citation in narrative review; per NIH guidance, detailed reference to \"where in the proposal\" text supports a claim is sufficient, rather than exact quotation.\n\n---\n\n## Regenerated NIH Peer Review (Fully Evidence-Based and Structured)\n\n---\n\n**Title:** Policy Development for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** R01\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis proposal addresses a timely and critical gap as WGS rapidly becomes widespread in clinical care, but U.S. regulatory, reimbursement, and IP frameworks remain piecemeal and often antiquated. Proposal evidence includes: a >1,000-fold reduction in sequencing cost (p.2), early signs of payer reimbursement for clinical WGS (p.2), mounting calls for regulatory modernization (NHGRI ELSI announcement; p.2), and public meetings convened by the FDA (p.3). Specific domains (test quality, reimbursement, IP) are strongly justified through examples of conflicting or limited policy coverage. The proposal is notable for its intent to develop actionable policy in “real time” as technologies advance, using real-world industry and policy leader input (p.2–3). However, the proposal’s decision to focus on just three policy domains, while strategic, limits its scope given broader needs (e.g., privacy, global harmonization), a fact noted but not robustly justified with external comparative evidence. The argument for urgency is clear but could be further grounded with recent quantitative trends in clinical WGS adoption or documented regulatory failures.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 4\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe methodology combines a systematic, web-based landscape analysis (see p.6–7) with up to 20 interviews drawn from a pool of at least 40 WGS companies, plus a five-survey, modified Delphi process with an expert panel of 40 stakeholders (pp.7–9). The review of relevant industry actors and use of multiphase, qualitative coding via NVivo is a strength for policy research. The Delphi rationale (panel size, 5 surveys, broad representation) is based on best practices and previous stakeholder panel experience; however, potential for unaddressed sector bias is present, as some stakeholder groups (such as payers or patients) may have less power compared to industry or academic actors (proposal acknowledges plans to solicit wide representation, p.9). The necessity and sufficiency of five survey rounds and interview saturation are described but not deeply justified as optimal in an evolving field. No statistical analysis for survey ranking is specified; prioritization is planned by Likert-based median scores and qualitative synthesis (p.14), which is acceptable but limits reproducibility and external validation. The proposal recognizes attrition and engagement risks (“low rates of attrition” in Delphi literature, p.9) but does not provide concrete contingency plans. Feasibility is high based on prior team experience in similar studies, but maintenance of panel engagement and timely updates of landscape analysis in a rapidly changing arena are significant risks.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe PIs and key personnel (Javitt, Gook-Deegan, Tunis, Deverka, Messner) are recognized authorities in genomics law, policy, reimbursement, and stakeholder consensus methods, with publications and funded work in all relevant domains (pp.5–6). The advisory board (with national leaders such as Evans, Church, Rothberg) demonstrates deep breadth. Data management and qualitative/Delphi expertise are explicitly described. No resource or expertise gaps are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA\n\n- **Human Subjects:**  \n  Involves expert interviews and panelists. While subjects are not patients, IRB review will likely be required, and the proposal states plans for confidentiality and de-identification (p.11). Informed consent and participant protections are recognized but would benefit from an explicit statement of IRB approval status.\n  \n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.  \n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.  \n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not specified; proposal appears to be new.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n  Data capture and qualitative coding tools are industry standard. No biologicals; interview/Delphi methodology is described and appropriate.\n\n- **Budget and Period of Support:**  \n  Budget details are not included; however, the timeline (20 months for Delphi panel, ongoing industry update) is ambitious but plausible for proposed aims. Lack of explicit budget precludes detailed assessment of adequacy.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe project tackles a pressing barrier to safe, effective, and equitable WGS implementation, with potential to inform major policy domains at a national level. Its greatest strengths are topic urgency, participatory design, and team expertise. The innovative, real-time stakeholder engagement and dissemination plans (white papers, policy briefings, targeted outreach) are well matched to the project's translational aims. However, feasibility is tempered by methodological limitations (possible stakeholder/perspective imbalance, unclear mitigation for field evolution, limited scope). The project's prioritization of three domains is reasonable but leaves major emerging areas for future work; it would be less likely to catalyze truly comprehensive reform without further breadth or explicit updating schemes. Thus, while impact is likely to be strong and sustained within defined policy areas, the risk of partial influence or obsolescence in rapidly changing environments lowers confidence in maximal, durable field-wide influence—justifying a score of 3.\n\n---\n\n**Major Strengths:**\n- Addresses timely, high-stakes barrier to genomic medicine translation\n- Clear, actionable aims\n- Innovative, inclusive stakeholder and dissemination strategy\n- Highly accomplished multidisciplinary team and advisory board\n\n**Key Weaknesses:**\n- Excludes major related domains (privacy, global policy, downstream impacts)\n- Methodological choices (Delphi rounds, sample size) warrant more rigorous justification and risk mitigation planning\n- Dissemination and sustainability beyond funding are insufficiently detailed\n- Some reliance on assumptions of engagement and update mechanisms\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOverall, the proposal is commendable, timely, and likely to exert a substantial impact on select policy facets of clinical WGS, provided risks and limitations are proactively addressed.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

This represents significant progress toward meeting NIH review standards.\n\n**Remaining Critical Flaws and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n**1. Scoring Inconsistencies:**\n- Factor 1 (Importance) receives a score of 3, despite describing the research as addressing \"timely and critical gap\" with \"strong justification\"\n- Overall Impact Score of 3 seems inflated given Factor 2 score of 4 (which indicates notable weaknesses)\n- The justifications don't clearly align with NIH scoring definitions (e.g., score of 3 = \"excellent\" but text emphasizes limitations)\n\n**2. Insufficient Critical Analysis:**\n- Factor 2 identifies multiple methodological concerns but still awards a relatively favorable score of 4\n- Missing critical evaluation of power calculations or sample size justification for the Delphi panel\n- No assessment of potential selection bias in choosing only 3 policy areas from team expertise rather than stakeholder priorities\n\n**3. Vague or Incomplete Assessments:**\n- States \"No statistical analysis for survey ranking is specified\" but doesn't sufficiently penalize this in scoring\n- Notes \"Budget details are not included\" but doesn't address how this affects feasibility assessment\n- Human subjects section lacks detail on ethical considerations for elite interviews\n\n**4. Logical Inconsistencies:**\n- Claims \"feasibility is high\" but then lists \"significant risks\" without reconciling\n- States the project will have \"substantial impact\" while giving mediocre scores\n- Describes \"innovative\" approaches but doesn't explain why modified Delphi is superior to alternatives\n\n**5. Missing Critical Elements:**\n- No discussion of preliminary data or pilot work\n- Insufficient evaluation of the 24-month timeline adequacy given rapid technology evolution\n- No assessment of dissemination plan effectiveness beyond listing activities\n\n**6. Superficial Treatment of Weaknesses:**\n- Lists domain exclusions as weakness but doesn't evaluate severity\n- Mentions \"possible stakeholder/perspective imbalance\" without analyzing recruitment strategy\n- Notes sustainability concerns but doesn't assess post-funding viability\n\n**Summary:**\nWhile this revised response shows marked improvement in format and structure, it still falls short of rigorous NIH peer review standards. The scoring appears generous relative to identified weaknesses, critical methodological elements receive insufficient scrutiny, and the analysis lacks the depth expected for transformative research evaluation. The review would benefit from more stringent scoring that accurately reflects the identified limitations and more thorough analysis of feasibility concerns.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

      "content": "The other agent (NIH_gpt_4.1) provided the following response. Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nBelow is a focused NIH-style evaluation of the investigative team—applying the required NIH peer review structure, scoring, and explicit evidence-based justification—assessing the qualifications, expertise, and track record of the leadership and team, with clear attention to both strengths and any meaningful limitations.\n\n---\n\n**FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)**\n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Evaluation and Evidence-Based Justification:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Leadership and Domain Expertise:**  \n  The project is co-led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, both of whom are established leaders in genetic policy, law, and bioethics (see p.5 of proposal). Kaufman has a notable record in genetic testing oversight and policy engagement; McGuire’s experience spans legal/ethical frameworks, public policy development, and the practical intersection of genomics and health care. Both have successfully managed prior NIH and foundation-funded research on policy challenges in genetics, evidencing relevant project management skills essential for this effort.\n\n- **Complementary Senior Personnel:**  \n  The team includes recognized authorities in each policy domain:\n    - Gail Javitt offers specialized expertise on FDA and CMS/CLIA regulation, having led the Genetic Testing Quality Initiative, and is well positioned to lead analytic validity/quality assurance work (proposal p.5–6).\n    - Robert Gook-Deegan is a national leader on intellectual property, gene patenting, and licensing, with major contributions to peer-reviewed policy research and practical guideline development (p.6).\n    - Sean Tunis, Pat Deverka, and Donna Messner of the Center for Medical Technology Policy have direct experience with payer policy, molecular diagnostics evaluation, and multi-stakeholder Delphi processes; Tunis, as a former Chief Medical Officer at CMS, brings exceptional understanding of the coverage landscape (p.6).\n    - Messner’s expertise in qualitative and stakeholder-engagement methods is clearly aligned with leading the structured Delphi components.\n  \n- **Advisory Board Depth:**  \n  The eight-member advisory board includes leading scientists (e.g., Jim Evans, George Church), legal scholars (Arti Rai), economists (Heidi Williams), and private sector innovators (Jonathan Rothberg). This ensures broad, cross-sectoral input and supports recruitment, dissemination, and ongoing methodological rigor (p.6).\n\n- **Track Record in Stakeholder Engagement and Policy:**  \n  The team collectively has demonstrated experience executing complex, multistakeholder consensus projects (see referenced Delphi panels, national policy guideline efforts, and engagement letters from relevant industry/academic bodies, p.9–10). Many have published influential policy guidance or recommendations adopted in national contexts.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses or Limitations:**\n- **Team Composition and Domain Breadth:**  \n  While all core project aims are mapped to domain experts, the focus is explicitly on three domains (test quality, reimbursement, IP). The team has comparatively less in-house expertise or specific commitment for domains such as privacy, healthcare informatics, or global regulatory harmonization—gaps acknowledged but not directly filled in the plan. This could limit responsiveness should panel-prioritized questions extend beyond the anticipated domains.\n\n- **Effort Allocation and Sustainability:**  \n  The proposal outlines that key senior personnel have significant roles (e.g., leading major work packages and Delphi operations), but explicit FTE/effort allocation details are not provided in the text excerpt. High-demand contributors are also actively leading other initiatives; while their prior engagement record is strong, there is risk that overall effort could be diluted across parallel commitments, especially in the event of unanticipated methodological or recruitment challenges.\n\n- **Potential for Stakeholder or Patient Perspective Underrepresentation:**  \n  The advisory and investigative core is heavily weighted toward policy, law, payer, and academic expertise; direct patient advocacy, regulatory, or health IT expertise, while present in the advisory group, may be less central to daily project operations. This could affect the day-to-day perspective diversity and translation of stakeholder priorities into actionable outputs.\n\n**Alignment with Project Aims:**\n- The PI and key team members are exceptionally well-aligned with all articulated aims, each overseeing policy development in their area of expertise. Their combined experience in landscape analysis, legal research, reimbursement science, stakeholder engagement, and Delphi facilitation provides confidence in the team’s ability to deliver on project requirements.\n- The advisory board’s breadth also positions the project to adapt to emergent questions or stakeholder needs within the defined three domains.\n- The team's national visibility, prior accomplishments in related ELSI/policy projects, and connections to governmental, payer, and industry networks further enhance the project’s capacity for impact and dissemination.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe investigative team demonstrates outstanding alignment, depth, and previous accomplishment across the primary aims and domains of this proposal, with no major expertise or resource gaps relative to those domains. Modest weaknesses include limited explicit commitment to peripheral policy areas (e.g., privacy, global policy) and a need for transparent effort allocation to assure sustained engagement. Overall, the team’s strengths substantially outweigh any weaknesses, supporting a “Sufficient” mark for Factor 3.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Fundamental Format Violation:**\n- Factor 3 requires only a binary assessment (Sufficient/Insufficient) with brief justification if Insufficient\n- The agent provides an extensive multi-paragraph analysis that violates the specified format\n- Instructions clearly state: \"Explanation (if Insufficient, 2–3 sentences)\" - since marked Sufficient, no extended explanation should be provided\n\n**2. Incorrect Application of Review Framework:**\n- The response evaluates only Factor 3 in isolation, failing to provide the complete NIH review\n- Missing Factor 1 (Importance of Research) and Factor 2 (Rigor and Feasibility) scores\n- No Overall Impact Score (1-9) provided\n- Missing all Additional Review Criteria sections\n\n**3. Overanalysis and Scope Creep:**\n- Provides detailed weakness analysis for a \"Sufficient\" rating, which is inappropriate\n- Discusses peripheral issues (privacy, global harmonization) beyond the proposal's stated scope\n- Speculates about FTE allocation without evidence that this information is missing or problematic\n\n**4. Unsupported Claims:**\n- States \"explicit FTE/effort allocation details are not provided\" without confirming this is actually missing\n- Assumes risk of \"effort dilution\" without evidence from the proposal\n- Makes unfounded assertions about potential underrepresentation without evaluating actual stakeholder panel composition\n\n**5. Logical Inconsistency:**\n- Identifies multiple \"weaknesses\" and \"limitations\" yet still rates as \"Sufficient\"\n- The extensive critique contradicts the binary sufficient rating\n- If these concerns were valid, the rating should be \"Insufficient\" with a brief explanation\n\n**6. Failure to Follow Instructions:**\n- The review specifically states to mark Sufficient OR Insufficient, then provide explanation only if Insufficient\n- Providing extensive analysis for a Sufficient rating demonstrates failure to follow the structured review format\n\n**Summary:**\nThis response fundamentally misunderstands the NIH review framework. Factor 3 is designed as a simple binary check, not an extensive analytical section. The agent's approach shows confusion about the review structure and fails to provide the complete evaluation required.

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nBelow is a comprehensive review of the grant proposal, structured according to the six core NIH criteria. For each section, I analyze strengths, weaknesses, and give actionable recommendations, with reference to proposal content and in line with NIH review conventions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. OVERALL IMPACT\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The proposal targets a critical inflection point in genomic medicine: the clinical integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS), where regulatory, reimbursement, and intellectual property frameworks urgently require modernization.\n- The team assembles deep expertise spanning law, policy, payer engagement, and consensus methods, supporting a robust, multi-stakeholder approach.\n- The active dissemination plan—including white papers, policy briefings, and ongoing engagement with regulatory and industry partners—increases the likelihood of timely uptake and real-world policy influence.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The project's primary focus on three policy domains (test quality, reimbursement, IP) limits its reach, leaving other significant policy challenges (e.g., privacy, data sharing, global harmonization) relatively unaddressed.\n- The sustainability of the project’s products and their continued relevance in a rapidly evolving policy and technology environment is somewhat unclear.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Expand the scope or at minimum, incorporate a defined plan for how additional domains, such as privacy or international harmonization, could be systematically prioritized in subsequent work.\n- Develop a mechanism for periodic policy update and stakeholder re-engagement to maintain the currency and utility of the project’s outputs beyond the initial funding period.\n\n---\n\n## 2. SIGNIFICANCE\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The proposal clearly demonstrates that existing regulatory frameworks are insufficient for WGS, citing sharp reductions in sequencing costs, early payer reimbursement, and national calls for regulatory reform.\n- The work is directly responsive to NHGRI ELSI priorities and is positioned to generate foundational policy infrastructure for clinical genomics.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The rationale for why the selected three domains represent the most urgent policy needs is more asserted than rigorously evidenced; other urgent areas such as data privacy are acknowledged but underjustified in their exclusion.\n- Although urgency is established, the lack of recent, quantitative uptake/impact data (e.g., growth in clinical WGS use, payer denials, or regulatory gaps) weakens the argument for the proposal’s centrality.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Provide more detailed justification, including comparative analysis or recent quantitative data, to support the selection of the three domains as the project’s immediate focus.\n- Strengthen the evidence base for the project's importance by incorporating data on WGS adoption rates, regulatory breakdowns, or adverse real-world impacts stemming from the current policy gap.\n\n---\n\n## 3. INVESTIGATORS\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The co-PIs and senior personnel are leaders in genomics policy, regulation, reimbursement, and bioethics, with demonstrated success managing complex stakeholder projects and published impact in national genetic policy.\n- The advisory board is composed of cross-sector authorities, increasing both scientific and implementation credibility.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- Detail regarding specific effort allocation among key personnel is not explicit, and it is unclear how sustained engagement will be assured during periods of competing obligations.\n- The core team’s expertise is heavily weighted toward law, policy, and payer perspectives; direct expertise on health informatics, patient advocacy, or global genomics appears less central.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Clearly outline effort and time commitments (e.g., %FTE) for all key personnel, and consider contingency planning for periods of high parallel project demand.\n- Consider broadening the core team (or advisory structure) to explicitly include representatives with deep expertise in health informatics, real-world clinical implementation, or patient/stakeholder advocacy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. INNOVATION\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The project’s real-time, stakeholder-driven policy development using a modified Delphi process is novel and responsive to dynamic field needs.\n- Combining systematic landscape analysis with iterative, broad panel consultation is an innovative method for priority setting in health policy research.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The Delphi process, while systematic, may still be subject to groupthink, dominance by certain stakeholders, or panel fatigue; the proposal acknowledges but does not elaborate on mitigation strategies.\n- The project’s dissemination and translation plan, though active, is conventional and does not leverage newer, interactive or global dissemination tools.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Detail specific strategies to counteract selection bias, dominance effects, or engagement fatigue within the Delphi process (e.g., targeted recruitment, incentivization, facilitation methods).\n- Consider incorporating more interactive or real-time dissemination platforms (e.g., online policy dashboards, living policy documents, international briefings) to increase impact and uptake.\n\n---\n\n## 5. APPROACH\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The combination of a structured landscape analysis, qualitative coding, multi-round Delphi survey, and a culminating in-person summit is carefully tailored for policy prioritization and consensus building.\n- The proposal describes multi-phase stakeholder engagement, panel diversity (by sector), and process transparency.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The justification for methodological decisions (Why 40 panelists? Why five rounds? How will statistical analysis of survey data be conducted and interpreted?) is underdeveloped.\n- Procedures for updating the landscape analysis and maintaining currency of data and recommendations as the field evolves are not explicit.\n- Risk management for low response rates, attrition, and ensuring comprehensive panel diversity could be more robust.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- More clearly articulate the empirical, methodological, or literature-based reasoning supporting key design choices in the Delphi process and landscape analysis.\n- Specify a regular schedule and predictive strategies for updating project outputs as new data or regulations emerge.\n- Implement and describe clear criteria and approaches for maximal diversity/inclusion and proactive management of attrition in the expert panel.\n\n---\n\n## 6. ENVIRONMENT\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The project leverages leading institutions (e.g., Genetics and Public Policy Center, Duke University, Center for Medical Technology Policy) with substantial infrastructure and experience in policy and multi-stakeholder research.\n- Letters of engagement from WGS companies and provider organizations strengthen potential for expert recruitment and impact.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- Details concerning data security, IT infrastructure, and access to analytic or dissemination platforms are only briefly discussed.\n- There is minimal information on institutional commitment to supporting continued work or updates after the project period.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Expand on the available IT and analytic infrastructure, data security protocols, and institutional resources supporting the Delphi process and policy dissemination.\n- Provide a plan or agreement with institutional partners outlining how key project products or platforms will be maintained, updated, or institutionalized after the grant ends.\n\n---\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nBelow is a comprehensive, NIH-structured peer review of the proposal, providing explicit 1–9 scores for each major factor and the Overall Impact, and summarizing strengths and weaknesses under each criterion, with justification grounded in the proposal content.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** Policy Development for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** R01\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Addresses a nationally significant and timely policy gap, as WGS rapidly advances towards routine clinical use and outpaces current regulatory and reimbursement frameworks.\n- Aligns closely with stated priorities of NIH and NHGRI, directly responding to the ELSI program announcement.\n- Well-justified focus on three actionable domains—test quality, reimbursement, and intellectual property—demonstrated as major bottlenecks through proposal references to cost reductions, clinical adoption, and policy inertia.\n- Approach is likely to inform best practices, support regulatory agencies, and facilitate responsible uptake of WGS in health care settings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Exclusion of other urgent domains (privacy, data security, global harmonization) narrows potential impact and may limit downstream comprehensiveness.\n- Justification for focusing solely on three domains is more asserted than empirically demonstrated; lacks quantitative data illustrating centrality of the selected issues compared to those omitted.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe problem is convincingly important and the approach is relevant to national needs. Yet, narrowing focus to three policy areas without empirical justification slightly tempers its field-wide significance.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 4\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Employs an appropriate mixed-methods approach: systematic landscape analysis, interviews with industry leaders, and a modified Delphi process with 40 multi-sector stakeholders.\n- Study design is grounded in prior experience from the team and advisory board with similar regulatory/policy studies.\n- Panel recruitment, confidentiality, and iterative consensus methodology are detailed; use of recognized software (NVivo), industry support, and letters of engagement increase feasibility.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Rationale for the size of the Delphi panel, number of survey rounds, and prioritization approach is based primarily on precedent rather than empirical/evidence-based justification.\n- The risk of panel attrition or dominance by certain stakeholder groups is acknowledged, but explicit mitigation strategies are not fully detailed.\n- Approach for ongoing updating of recommendations and adaptation to continued technology/policy evolution is underdeveloped.\n- Dissemination and sustainability strategies, including tracking impact and maintaining products after funding, are not robustly specified.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe design is fit for purpose and achievable given the team's expertise, but lacks detail on risk management and longer-term product updating or sustainability, especially critical in a rapidly evolving field.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Strengths:**\n- PIs and key personnel are well-established leaders in genomics law, policy, and stakeholder engagement; advisory board includes authoritative figures representing diverse sectors.\n- Prior success in managing complex, national policy projects and stakeholder panels directly supports project aims.\n- Institutional infrastructure and data management capabilities for qualitative and survey research are present.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Depth in health informatics, global genomics policy, or direct patient advocacy is less apparent within the core investigative team, possibly limiting perspective on broader or future policy needs.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe expertise and resources are fully adequate for all stated aims and domains, with no material gaps that would threaten project completion.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA\n\n- **Human Subjects:**  \n  Involves expert interviews and Delphi panel participants. IRB review and informed consent are recognized but not fully documented; protocols for participant protection are described but should be finalized prior to study initiation.\n\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.  \n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.  \n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not addressed; presumed new submission.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n  Data will be managed with standard qualitative tools and de-identification protocols.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:**  \n  Not detailed in the provided text; plan appears broadly appropriate for R01 mechanism and scope.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Tackles an urgent, highly-relevant national policy gap; approach and team are well aligned to translate findings into actionable policy guidance.\n- Stakeholder engagement is rigorous and multi-tiered, with likely impact on regulatory, payer, and clinical policy settings.\n- Dissemination plan, including targeted briefings and public reports, supports broad reach and practical uptake.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Impact is limited by project scope (three domains rather than comprehensive policy needs) and by risks in panel representativeness, engagement, and product sustainability in a dynamic environment.\n- Lack of concrete mechanisms for long-term updating and absence of formal statistical or power analysis for prioritization procedures reduce confidence in ongoing influence.\n\n**Justification:**  \nProject is poised to exert meaningful, sustained influence within defined domains but its broader, lasting national impact is only moderate due to scope, feasibility, and sustainability limitations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nA strong, well-structured proposal that addresses a central need in clinical genomics policy with experienced leadership and a rigorous consultative methodology. Main limitations relate to scope, evolving content, and sustaining engagement and impact as the field changes.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

However, it contains several important flaws:\n\n**1. Scoring Inconsistencies and Unjustified Ratings:**\n- Factor 1 receives a score of 3 (\"Excellent\") despite describing the proposal as addressing \"nationally significant and timely policy gap\" with direct NHGRI alignment\n- The weakness cited (focusing on three domains) is actually a strength for feasibility and doesn't justify lowering from a 1-2 score\n- Overall Impact Score of 3 seems inappropriately high given the extensive weaknesses listed\n\n**2. Mischaracterization of Proposal Content:**\n- Claims \"lacks quantitative data illustrating centrality of the selected issues\" - the proposal clearly states these three domains were identified in the program announcement as important\n- States dissemination strategies are \"not robustly specified\" despite Aim 3 detailing white papers, briefings, webcasts, and partnership with Burness Communications\n- Incorrectly identifies this as an R01 when the mechanism isn't specified in the proposal\n\n**3. Flawed Critique of Methods:**\n- Criticizes Delphi panel size (n=40) as lacking empirical justification, when this is standard for Delphi studies and the proposal cites methodological precedent\n- Claims \"absence of formal statistical or power analysis\" for a qualitative policy study where such analyses would be inappropriate\n- Misses that the proposal explicitly states consensus is NOT the goal\n\n**4. Inadequate Assessment of Innovation:**\n- Fails to recognize this as the first U.S.-centered WGS policy landscape analysis\n- Doesn't acknowledge the methodological innovation of applying modified Delphi to genomic policy\n- Undervalues the timing advantage of addressing policy before practices become entrenched\n\n**5. Logical Inconsistencies:**\n- Identifies team expertise as \"Sufficient\" with strong prior success, yet gives Overall Impact of 3\n- Lists extensive strengths under each factor but assigns middling scores\n- Claims \"moderate\" national impact for a project addressing the entire U.S. WGS policy framework\n\n**6. Missing Critical Strengths:**\n- No mention of the exceptional advisory board (Church, Rothberg, etc.)\n- Ignores the comprehensive three-part approach (landscape analysis, Delphi, dissemination)\n- Fails to credit the direct policy translation pathway through Congressional briefings\n\n**Summary:**\nWhile this review follows proper NIH format, it demonstrates insufficient understanding of policy research methods and contains multiple scoring inconsistencies. The reviewer appears to apply quantitative research standards to a qualitative policy study and penalizes appropriate scope limitation. The scores don't align with the described strengths, suggesting either scoring inflation or inadequate justification. Most critically, the review fails to recognize the proposal's positioning at a unique historical moment for maximal policy impact.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nBelow is a comprehensive NIH-style review, integrating your requested high-level analysis across six core sections: Overall Impact, Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, and Environment. For each, I provide an evidence-based score (1=exceptional, 9=poor), specific strengths and weaknesses, and actionable recommendations, adhering strictly to NIH review conventions as refined through prior feedback.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT  \n**Score:** 1  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The proposal addresses a critical policy vacuum at the optimal “policy window” for clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS), aiming for foundational influence on national standards and best practices.\n- Synchronizes perfectly with NIH/NHGRI priorities and current ELSI announcement, maximizing translational potential.\n- Combines pioneering methods (landscape analysis, stakeholder-driven Delphi, direct policy dissemination) with national reach and demonstrated expertise.\n- Advisory board and dissemination plan (including policy briefings and national outreach) ensure that outputs will reach key decision-makers at federal and industry levels.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The explicit mechanism for policy guidance sustainability and periodic updating after the grant ends could be better articulated.\n- While the project plans for broad dissemination, strategies to ensure adoption into formal regulatory and reimbursement environments are less fully developed.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Develop a clear plan for updating recommendations/policy products in response to technological and regulatory changes.\n- Engage relevant regulatory and payer bodies early as implementation partners, not just recipients.\n\n---\n\n### SIGNIFICANCE  \n**Score:** 1  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Directly tackles urgent regulatory and policy gaps resulting from the rapid rise of WGS technology.\n- Targeted focus on domains (quality, reimbursement, IP) is justified by both the NHGRI program announcement and the magnitude of current barriers.\n- Strong linkage to major public health outcomes and clinical implementation: the project will help determine how WGS can be responsibly, equitably, and efficiently adopted into practice.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The rationale for narrowing to three policy domains, though tied to program priorities, could cite more external empirical or stakeholder evidence to reinforce these as the singular, most pressing needs.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Explicitly link exclusion of other domains (privacy, interoperability, access) to risk prioritization frameworks or published policy analyses, and outline pathways for addressing these via future projects.\n\n---\n\n### INVESTIGATORS  \n**Score:** 1  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Co-PIs and senior team members are widely recognized for leadership and scholarship in genomics policy, regulation, reimbursement, law, and Delphi/stakeholder engagement.\n- Advisory board includes national authorities from genomics, law, technology, and economics, creating a “dream team” for cross-sectoral policy innovation.\n- Documented record of successful delivery of multisectoral policy projects and peer-reviewed guidance adopted in practice.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Team core has comparatively less emphasis on informatics and direct patient/consumer engagement within the lead personnel (though these views are present in broader panels).\n- Individual effort allocation (% FTE) and contingency for potential investigator overload or transitions are not fully detailed.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Briefly specify backup plans for any investigator turnover and clarify how patient/consumer and informatics perspectives will be formally integrated into project leadership and regular activities.\n\n---\n\n### INNOVATION  \n**Score:** 1  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- First to systematically map and prioritize U.S. WGS policy needs as clinical use emerges.\n- Groundbreaking use of a modified Delphi consensus process at scale, paired with “real-time” landscape analysis and direct policy engagement.\n- Proactive, interactive dissemination strategy leverages both traditional (briefings, white papers) and contemporary communication resources.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Risk of participant fatigue or dominance in the Delphi process, potentially influencing the breadth of input or applicability of consensus-based outputs.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Outline specific practices to maintain engagement and minimize dominance (e.g., formal facilitation, feedback loops, anonymized scoring) and plan for adaptive process evaluation after each Delphi round.\n\n---\n\n### APPROACH  \n**Score:** 2  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Methodologically rigorous, combining up-to-date industry mapping with well-established stakeholder engagement and consensus-building protocols.\n- Recruitment plan and representation across stakeholders (industry, payers, regulators, advocacy) is strong.\n- Use of advisory board input to shape Delphi rounds and analysis ensures iterative quality control.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Mechanisms for regular updating of results, attrition management for the Delphi panel, and maintaining panel diversity over five rounds could be described more concretely.\n- Processes for communicating both consensus and divergence (when consensus is not achieved) are briefly noted but not fully developed.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Incorporate a timeline and template for panel refresh or new recruitment if attrition rises, and publish clear protocols for handling minority opinions and dissent within final products.\n\n---\n\n### ENVIRONMENT  \n**Score:** 1  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The lead institutions and collaborative centers possess notable infrastructure and track records for running large-scale policy analyses and multi-institutional engagement.\n- Clear access to key stakeholder organizations and service providers, facilitating data collection and dissemination.\n- Letters of support and engagement reinforce resource stability.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- IT/data security plans and logistical support for a large, multi-round Delphi panel are not extensively described.\n- Unclear how long-term hosting, data storage, or public access to results and tools will be managed if project funding ends.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Provide more detail on IT/data management plans, ongoing support for stakeholder engagement tools, and how results/resources will remain accessible and findable for policymakers and the research community post-award.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis proposal is exceptionally well aligned with national need and scientific opportunity, combining methodological rigor, innovation, and a highly credible team. Its few weaknesses are mostly logistical and could be addressed through modest additional planning. The project stands to exert a profound and enduring influence on U.S. genomic policy development, serving as a model for the responsible translation of new omics technologies into clinical care.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Each section—Overall Impact, Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, and Environment—is scored (1=exceptional to 9=poor) and includes strengths, weaknesses, actionable recommendations, and direct citations (by page number) from the proposal text. These criteria are then grouped and scored as NIH Factors: Importance of the Research, Rigor and Feasibility, and Expertise and Resources. All critical review elements and structure are included as specified.\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 1 — IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Addresses a foundational barrier in U.S. genomic medicine: the lack of policy frameworks for WGS clinical integration as sequencing becomes routine and increasingly affordable (pp.1–2).\n- Timed to inform emerging practices before standards become entrenched (p.4).\n- Direct response to the NHGRI ELSI program announcement, maximizing national policy relevance (p.2).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Sustainability and policy updating mechanisms could be stronger (p.13).\n  \n**Recommendations:**  \n- Design a roadmap for ongoing policy updates and engagement beyond the project period.\n\n---\n\n### SIGNIFICANCE  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Clearly identifies current policy gaps for WGS: regulatory frameworks built for single-gene diagnostics are outmoded in the era of large-scale genomic data (pp.1–3).\n- Focused on three domains—test quality, reimbursement, IP—directly cited as urgent by federal programmatic mandates and by expert analysis (pp.1–2, 5).\n- References the >1,000-fold reduction in sequencing costs and increasing clinical adoption, supported by expert and industry statements (pp.2–3, 5).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Greater external empirical data or a formal risk prioritization rationale (e.g., for prioritizing test quality, reimbursement, and IP over privacy or downstream issues) would further strengthen the case (pp.1–2).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Reference additional stakeholder or empirical analyses to clarify the primary focus, and crosswalk to how adjacent policy needs could be prioritized in future research.\n\n---\n\n**Group Score for FACTOR 1: Importance:**  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Citations:** pp.1–2, 4–5\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 2 — RIGOR AND FEASIBILITY\n\n### INNOVATION  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Strengths:**  \n- First systematic, U.S.-centered policy mapping of the clinical WGS industry (p.4, p.6).\n- Applies a modified Delphi process of rare scale and transparency to regulatory science (pp.4, 7).\n- Proactive, detailed dissemination plan includes white papers, policy briefings, webcasts, and communications support (pp.2, 4, 7).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Delphi process could be vulnerable to participant attrition or dominant voices, potentially reducing breadth and inclusivity of final recommendations (p.9).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Specify engagement retention and facilitation strategies for the full Delphi process.\n\n---\n\n### APPROACH  \n**Score:** 2  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Combines comprehensive landscape analysis (pp.6–7), 20 semi-structured interviews (p.7), and a five-round, 40-member modified Delphi panel for consensus-building (pp.7–9).\n- Process reflects demonstrated best practice for qualitative policy research and is supported by previous stakeholder/panel engagement success (p.5–6).\n- Panel recruitment, survey design, and analytic workflow are thoughtfully described (pp.8–10).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Specific procedures for panel refresh, managing attrition, and addressing minority or dissenting opinions are underdeveloped (p.9).\n- More details on the frequency and triggers for updating the landscape analysis and recommendations would strengthen the approach (p.11).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Add an explicit process for panel renewal/refreshment, attrition tracking, and cycling in new expertise as required during the study.\n- Build and document an ongoing monitoring protocol for industry/policy changes.\n\n---\n\n**Group Score for FACTOR 2: Rigor and Feasibility:**  \n**Score:** 2  \n**Citations:** pp.4, 6–11\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 3 — EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES\n\n### INVESTIGATORS  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Leadership (Kaufman/McGuire) and senior team have exceptional records in genomics

Fundamental Structure Violations:**\n- The framework explicitly states to use **only** the three-factor system (Importance, Rigor/Feasibility, Expertise/Resources), not the six-section format used here\n- Incorrectly presents individual section scores (Overall Impact, Significance, etc.) when the framework requires only factor scores\n- The \"Summary Table\" format is not part of the specified template\n\n**2. Missing Required Elements:**\n- No grant mechanism identified (R01, R21, etc.)\n- Overall Impact Score should appear at the end, not within Factor 1\n- Factor 3 should be marked as \"Sufficient/Insufficient,\" not given a numeric score\n- Additional Review Criteria section incomplete (missing Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions)\n\n**3. Scoring Inconsistencies:**\n- Gives Factor 3 a score of \"1\" when it should be \"Sufficient\" or \"Insufficient\"\n- Places Overall Impact Score within Factor 1 evaluation rather than as a separate final assessment\n- The scoring appears inflated - nearly all \"1\" scores despite identified weaknesses\n\n**4. Content Issues:**\n- Many \"recommendations\" exceed the reviewer's role (e.g., \"Design a roadmap for ongoing policy updates\")\n- Weaknesses often don't align with the exceptional scores given\n- Some citations are vague (\"pp.5-6, 8-9, 11\") rather than specific\n\n**5. Format and Presentation:**\n- Excessive use of formatting (tables, bold text) not specified in the framework\n- The review reads more like a grant consultation than an objective peer review\n- \"Respectfully submitted\" closing is inappropriate for the review format\n\n**6. Logical Inconsistencies:**\n- Identifies \"underdeveloped\" panel refresh procedures as a weakness but still awards a score of 2 (high merit)\n- Notes lack of patient/consumer representation but gives Investigators a score of 1\n- Acknowledges sustainability concerns but awards exceptional Overall Impact\n\n**Summary:**\nWhile this review attempts to follow NIH structure more closely than previous efforts, it fundamentally misunderstands the Two-Agent Framework by using a six-section format instead of the three-factor system. The review also fails to properly score Factor 3 and misplaces the Overall Impact Score. To be compliant, the review must strictly follow the specified three-factor template with appropriate scoring conventions.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, AI assistant.\n\nThank you for your feedback and that of NIH_claude_opus4. I have revised the review below, correcting the marking for Factor 3 (Expertise and Resources) to “Sufficient” or “Insufficient” (not scored), clarifying the role as a reviewer (not a consultant), explicitly including the mechanism as “R01” based on proposal context, and tightening citations to reference specific, unambiguous points from the application.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** Policy Development for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** R01\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 1: IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH\n\n### Significance  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Strengths:**  \n- The proposal identifies an urgent policy gap as WGS technology enters clinical use, with current frameworks designed only for single-gene tests (p.1, “The current regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing ... was not designed to integrate WGS into clinical practice”).\n- Highlights the rapid decrease in sequencing costs—a >1,000-fold reduction, showing the disruptive potential of WGS (p.3, “the cost of sequencing an entire human genome was $10.4 million; today it is 1,000 times less expensive”).\n- Targets three domains (test quality, reimbursement, IP) directly named in the NHGRI PA-11-250 program announcement as urgent areas for policy intervention (p.2, “We have organized a group with expertise in three of the domains where WGS poses unique challenges: oversight of test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and the coverage and reimbursement…”).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The rationale for not addressing other pressing issues such as privacy and international data sharing is limited to acknowledgment, without explicit prioritization strategy or supporting data (p.4).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Strengthen justification for domain selection by referencing recent stakeholder reports or quantitative policy analyses showing their primacy over other gaps.\n\n---\n\n**Group Score for FACTOR 1: Importance of the Research:**  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Citations:** p.1, p.2, p.3, p.4\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 2: RIGOR AND FEASIBILITY\n\n### Innovation  \n**Score:** 1  \n**Strengths:**  \n- First systematic, real-time analysis of U.S. WGS policy needs combining landscape analysis, expert interviews, and iterative Delphi methodology (p.6, “first systematic, landscape analysis of the current WGS industry”; p.7, “five online surveys and a two-day meeting ... spanning 20 months”).\n- Delphi design ensures multiple rounds of expert input and broad panelist representation from academia, industry, payers, and agencies (p.9, “Forty candidates will be selected to represent ... the WGS industry ... the health care system ... policymakers, academics and the public”).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Explicit mechanisms for ensuring consistent panel diversity, minimizing attrition, or refreshing stakeholder representation over the Delphi process are briefly referenced but not fully operationalized (p.9, “non-response and attrition rates in Delphi processes tend to be very low”).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Add a detailed panel management plan, including thresholds or triggers for refresh, and processes for ensuring continuous multi-sectoral balance through all Delphi rounds.\n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n**Score:** 2  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Mixed methods: systematic online/industry review, up to 20 semi-structured leader interviews, five-round Delphi prioritization, and in-person panel summit (pp.6–10).\n- Survey instruments pilot tested and reviewed by the advisory board (p.10, “instruments for the later rounds will be determined by the panel responses ... piloted with advisory board members”).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Updating or maintaining findings past the grant period is not described (p.11, “We also intend for this resource to be regularly updated and used by the wider research and policy communities”).\n- Limited description of analytic methods for resolving disagreement or reporting minority opinions from the Delphi results (p.10, “not the goal ... to reach consensus ... more detailed opinions about policy approaches”).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Specify triggers and mechanisms for product updates and clarify reporting for non-consensus positions.\n\n---\n\n**Group Score for FACTOR 2: Rigor and Feasibility:**  \n**Score:** 2  \n**Citations:** p.6, p.7, p.9, p.10, p.11\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 3: EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES\n\n### Investigators  \n**Mark:** Sufficient  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Extensive leadership in policy, law, reimbursement, and implementation science (p.5, “The research team will be led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, who combine significant expertise in genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics…”).\n- Advisory board includes top-tier authorities across sectors (p.6, “Advisory board members include: Jim Evans, ... George Church, ... Jonathan Rothberg, ... Heidi Williams”).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Some limitations in direct patient/consumer co-leadership in the PI team, but this is offset by the broad stakeholder representation in the advisory board and Delphi panels (p.9).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Consider integrating formal mechanisms to ensure sustained patient/stakeholder voice at the leadership level throughout the project—not just in advisory or panel roles.\n\n---\n\n### Environment  \n**Mark:** Sufficient  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Leveraging well-resourced institutions and national leaders in clinical genomics and policy (p.5–6).\n- Demonstrated track record of successful execution of multi-institutional, multi-stakeholder research (p.6, “These analyses will be written up into white papers and disseminated to panel members ... Drs.

The application provides a rigorous, stakeholder-driven policy prioritization framework utilizing a systematic landscape analysis, structured interviews, and a modified Delphi process with a 40-member expert panel representing industry, payers, providers, regulators, and patient groups (p.2, p.7, p.9). The investigative team comprises recognized leaders in genomics policy, regulation, and multi-stakeholder consensus, supported by an exceptional advisory board (p.5–6). Major strengths include direct policy translation pathways (white papers, Congressional briefings, webcasts; p.2, p.7), alignment with NHGRI ELSI goals (p.2), and methodologic innovation (first real-time, U.S.-centered policy mapping for WGS; p.6). Notable weaknesses include a primary focus on just three policy domains, limited detail on how findings will be kept current after project period, lack of explicit plan for attrition or panel diversity maintenance, and incomplete discussion of analytic or implementation risks (pp.9-11). These limitations modestly reduce confidence in both scope and long-term sustainability, but are outweighed by strong design, urgency, and feasibility. The project is well positioned to produce influential, field-shaping policy guidance.\n\n---\n\n### SIGNIFICANCE  \n**Score:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Clearly articulates why existing regulatory apparatus is inadequate for clinical WGS, citing rapid cost declines (p.3, “the cost of sequencing an entire human genome was $10.4 million; today it is 1,000 times less expensive”), and an explicit lack of scalable regulatory solutions (p.1).\n- Targeted domains (test quality, reimbursement, IP) are directly cited in the program announcement and reflect urgent, pragmatic needs identified by national policy authorities (p.2).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The prioritization of three core domains excludes critical, contemporaneous issues (notably privacy, secondary data use), and the justification for this exclusion is not supported by comparative needs assessments or empirical data.\n  \n**Citations:**  \n- p.1: “The current regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing … was not designed to integrate WGS into clinical practice.”  \n- p.2: “We have organized a group with expertise in three of the domains where WGS poses unique challenges … test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and coverage and reimbursement.”\n\n---\n\n### INNOVATION  \n**Score:** 1\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- This is the first comprehensive, U.S.-centered policy study targeting WGS’s clinical integration as use rapidly expands (p.6, “first systematic, landscape analysis of the current WGS industry…”).\n- Introduces a modified Delphi process to U.S. genomics policy research with real-time industry mapping, an in-person stakeholder summit, and mechanisms for direct policy translation (p.4, p.6–7).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The proposal could address the risk of panel fatigue or dominance by particular stakeholders in greater detail.\n\n**Citations:**  \n- p.4: “We propose using an innovative modified Delphi approach to ensure the systematic incorporation of a wide range of highly relevant perspectives…”\n\n---\n\n### APPROACH  \n**Score:** 3\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Integrates well-accepted qualitative methods (landscape analysis, semi-structured interviews, multi-round Delphi), adaptable to an evolving field (pp.6-10).\n- The planned 40-member Delphi panel is a size appropriate for breadth and manageability in standard policy settings (p.9).\n- Stakeholder selection, survey sequence, and advisory board input are addressed (p.10).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- No formal power/sample size calculation or explicit justification for n=40, except reference to prior Delphi practice.\n- Lacks detail on processes for managing panel attrition, selection bias, or maintenance of diversity over the project course.\n- Unclear how panel dissent/minority opinions are systematically documented or reported in outputs.\n- No explicit mechanism is defined for updating outputs or findings post-grant, and the 20-month timeline may be short if major policy or technology shifts occur mid-project.\n\n**Citations:**  \n- p.9: “Forty candidates will be selected to represent the following categories of stakeholders…”\n- p.11: “We also intend for this resource to be regularly updated and used by the wider research and policy communities.”\n\n---\n\n### INVESTIGATORS  \n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- PIs and senior personnel have long-standing, cross-disciplinary leadership in genomic policy, law, reimbursement, and stakeholder methodology, including prior successful Delphi-based and policy translation work (p.5).\n- The advisory board features recognized leaders in genomics (Church, Rothberg), legal and economic policy (Rai, Williams), and clinical practice (Evans), ensuring high-level oversight (p.6).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Limited description of expertise in advanced data science (AI/ML) for WGS interpretation or direct consumer/patient engagement as project co-leads, though these domains are supported via the advisory board and stakeholder panel.\n\n**Citations:**  \n- p.5: “[Kaufman and McGuire] combine significant expertise in genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics…”  \n- p.6: “Advisory board members include: Jim Evans… George Church… Jonathan Rothberg… Heidi Williams.”\n\n---\n\n### ENVIRONMENT  \n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Applies institutional resources from established genomic policy centers with successful multi-institutional, multi-stakeholder experience (p.6).\n- Institutional letters and access to policy, legal, and technical capacity are supported.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Limited detail on IT/data infrastructure and security for Delphi engagement and qualitative data management.\n- The plan for sustaining or hosting outreach platforms, project data, or deliverables after the grant period is underdeveloped.\n\n**Citations:**  \n- p.6: “[The research team will leverage] the expertise, insight, and working relationships established by an accomplished study team and a diverse panel of stakeholders…”\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA\n\n- **Human Subjects:**  \n  Minimal risk;

The proposal notes IRB review will be sought, but final approval and protocol details are not provided.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:**  Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:**  \n  Not detailed. Personnel structure and 20+ month timeline (p.9) appear reasonable for scope.\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n  Uses established qualitative and consensus research tools and procedures (p.7).\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR SCORES\n\n| FACTOR                           | SCORE / MARK    | CITATIONS            |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Importance of the Research        | 2               | p.1, p.2, p.3        |\n| Rigor and Feasibility             | 3               | pp.6, 9, 10, 11      |\n| Expertise and Resources           | Sufficient      | p.5, p.6, p.9, p.11  |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis proposal directly targets priority policy gaps for clinical WGS at a crucial moment for implementation. Its strengths—timing, design, national stakeholder engagement, and team expertise—outweigh its moderate risks. The limitations, mostly concerning maintenance of impact, panel management, and analytic detail, warrant minor caution but do not diminish the project’s potential to substantially advance the policy landscape.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Structural and Procedural Violations:**\n- The review uses a non-standard table format for factor scores instead of integrating them within the narrative structure\n- \"Significance,\" \"Innovation,\" and \"Approach\" are presented as separate scored sections, which is NOT part of the NIH Two-Agent Framework specified in the instructions\n- The framework calls for Factor 1 (Importance) and Factor 2 (Rigor and Feasibility), not the traditional NIH review criteria\n\n**2. Scoring Inconsistencies:**\n- Awards an Overall Impact Score of 2 despite identifying substantial weaknesses including \"limited detail on how findings will be kept current,\" \"lack of explicit plan for attrition,\" and \"incomplete discussion of analytic or implementation risks\"\n- The Innovation section receives a score of 1 (exceptional) with minimal justification and only one minor weakness identified\n- Scoring appears overly generous given the documented limitations\n\n**3. Citation Problems:**\n- Uses imprecise page ranges (e.g., \"pp.6-10,\" \"pp.9-11\") rather than specific citations\n- Some citations don't directly support the claims made (e.g., citing p.11 for \"regularly updated\" when this is aspirational)\n- Missing specific quotes for several key assertions\n\n**4. Analytical Weaknesses:**\n- The \"Reflection\" section acknowledges problems but then repeats many of the same errors\n- Fails to critically evaluate the 40-person sample size beyond noting it's \"appropriate for breadth\"\n- Doesn't adequately address the fundamental tension between the 24-month timeline and rapidly evolving technology\n\n**5. Missing Critical Elements:**\n- No evaluation of preliminary data or pilot work\n- Insufficient analysis of budget appropriateness (noted as \"not detailed\")\n- Limited discussion of how the three policy domains were selected over other critical areas\n\n**6. Self-Contradictory Elements:**\n- The reflection admits to \"scoring inconsistencies\" but then provides scores that exhibit the same problem\n- Acknowledges need for \"encyclopedic assessment of team expertise\" but provides only superficial coverage\n\n**Summary:**\nWhile this revised response demonstrates awareness of the required format, it fundamentally misunderstands the specific Two-Agent Framework outlined in the instructions. The review should focus on Factor 1 (Importance of Research, combining Significance and Innovation) and Factor 2 (Rigor and Feasibility), not traditional NIH criteria. The generous scoring despite substantial weaknesses, imprecise citations, and structural deviations from the specified framework indicate this review still does not meet the standards required for this specific review process.\n\nRespectfully,\nNIH_claude_opus4",
