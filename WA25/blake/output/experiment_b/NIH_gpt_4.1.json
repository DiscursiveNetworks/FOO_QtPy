The extent to which genomics will improve health outcomes on a \npopulation level, however,\ndepends in part on effective oversight. The volume of information generated by \nWGS and the uncertainty about\nthe utility of the data, the indications for which it should be used, who will \npay for it, and the extent to which\npatents and licensing affect access are all issues that command the attention of  \nthe policy community. The\ncurrent regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing and \nnewborn screening was not\ndesigned to integrate WGS into clinical practice. Thus, new policy approaches \nmay be required ta establish a\nsystem that guarantees appropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data \nand valid reports while\nencouraging innovation. The proposed study will respond directly to the program \nannouncement PA-11-250 to\nbegin to prioritize and address the unique policy challenges raised by WGS using  \na systematic consultation\nthat could be applied to future regulatory work in this area.\nWe have organized a group with expertise in three of the domains where WGS poses  \nunique challenges:\noversight of test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and the \ncoverage and reimbursement of\nWS. In consultation with an expert stakeholder panel, we will systematically \ndelineate and prioritize an\nauthcritative list of specific, tractable questions that policymakers should \nconsider as WGS comes to the clinic.\nWe will select three high-priority questions within our three domains, and work \nwith the panel to develop policy\napproaches to address them. This work will be informed by an initial landscape \nanalysis of the current and\nnear-future status of he WGS industry, as described by several of its leaders. \nBuilding on our team's expertise\nand extensive experience in both genetic testing policy and stakeholder \nengagement methods, we propose the\nfollowing aims to answer the call for regulatory science needed to inform \ndecision making in the face of rapid\ndevelopments in genomic healthcare.\nAim 1. Describe the current whole genome sequencing industry to establish a \nbasis for identifying\nand addressing related policy issues. To provide a clear understanding of WGS, \nwe will conduct the first\nU.S-centered landscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing on the \ngeneration, delivery, and\ninterpretation of genomic data. A review of literature, websites and company \nmaterials will be enhanced by\ninterviewing industry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS.\nAim 2. Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole genome \nsequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nto iteratively engage key siakeholders. Using our landscape analysis, our \ninterview data, and our\nknowledge of current standards and peclicy, we will develop a preliminary list \nof policy questions unique to\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nthe clinical use of WGS. A panel of 40 key stakeholders will then be iteratively  \nsurveyed to add to and refine\nthis list and to rank the resulting questions in terms of importance and \ntractability. An authoritative list of clear\npolicy priorities related to the clinical use WGS will result.\nWe will then develop policy approaches to address three high-priority issues, \none from each area of our team's\nexpertise: test quality and validity, healthcare reimbursement, and intellectual  \nproperty. We will systematically\nanalyze the extent to which current laws, professional guidelines, and industry \nstandards contribute to or\naddress the selected questions. Using this analysis as a starting point, we will  \nagain iteratively survey\nstakeholders to solicit and refine a variety of policy approaches to the \nquestions. The resulting set of\napproaches will be discussed by the stakeholder panel at a summit meeting to \nidentify areas of agreement and\nreasons for disagreement. A report summarizing how our methods and findings \nmight be applied to the\nbroader range of WGS policy issues will be developed and disseminated.\nAim 3. Disseminate findings to policymakers and key stakeholders. Beginning with  \nthe landscape\nanalysis, we will distribute our findings in concise, accessible formats (e.g., \nwhite papers, briefs, webcasts) to a\nbroad range of stakeholders to inform policy development. Two public briefings \nfor Washington-based\npolicymakers will be held to disseminate findings fram the Delphi process. \nFollow-up meetings with select\nfederal officials, Gongressional members and staff will be used to begin focused  \ndialogues on clinical WGS.\nSpecific Aims Page 101\n============================================================\nPage 2\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nRESEARCH STRATEGY\nA. SIGNIFICANCE\nThis application responds directly to one of the primary goals of the NHGRI \nprogram announcement \"Ethical,\nLegal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Genomic Research Regular Research \nProgram\" (PA-11-250},' which\nreads \"New legal and regulatory approaches need to be crafted in anticipation of  \nor in response to rapid\ndevelopments in genomic research and genomic health care....Research will be \nneeded to explore the effects\nof existing policies and regulations and to provide data to inform the \ndevelopment of new policies and\nregulatory approaches.â \nRapid innovation in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has brought us \nwhole genome sequencing\n(WWGS) that can be generated quickly and cheaply enough to be used for clinical \npurposes. In 1996, President\nClinton tantalized the public when he said: â I think it won't be too many \nyears before parents will be able to\ngo home from the hospital with their newborn babies with a genetic map in their \nhands that will tell them,\nhere's what your child's future will likely be like.â  Jay Flatley, CEO of \nIllumina, predicted that WGS would be\nâ technically feasible and affordableâ  by 2014 and â routineâ  by 2019.    \nExactly five years ago, in October 2008,\nthe cost of sequencing an entire human genome was $10.4 million; today it is \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n1,000 times less expensive.Â° The\nNHGRI has recently committed an additional $18 million to spur development of \nfaster technologies.* Some\nresearchers predict that five years from now it will be possible to sequence an \nentire human genome in a\nmatter of hours for $100 or less.*Â°\nDemonstrating the clinica] potential of these new technologies, whole exome \nsequencing (WES) and WGS\nhave already been used successfully to diagnose and treat disease,â  Â° and \ninsurance companies have agreed\nto cover the cost of WGS in at least two cases.\"' A growing number of diagnostic  \nlaboratories are adding next-\ngeneration sequencing to their menu of services.'* Some experts think genomic \nsequencing is ready for\nroutine clinical use.'*\"*\nAlthough the technology had advanced to the point where it can be used address \nspecific clinical questions an\nemerging consensus that the U.S. health care system does not have an established  \nsystem of procedures,\nknowledge and resources to effectively interpret and deliver WGS information to \npatients and providers.\nThe extent to which genomic medicine improves health outcames on a population \nlevel will depend on the\neffective oversight of clinical WGS. The current regulatory framework that \nguides single-gene diagnostic\ntesting and newborn screening were not designed with the complexity of whole \ngenome sequencing in mind,\nand will not suffice without new approaches or creative applications of existing  \npolicy.\nEric Green and Mark Guyer recently wrote that \"the amount and heterogeneous \nnature of the data, which will\ninclude both expected and unexpected results, will antiquate current mechanisms \nfor delivering medical\ninformation to patientsâ .'Â° The mechanisms currently in place are themselves \nthe result of extensive research\nio craft a system of regulatory policies that guide the practice of genetic \ntesting.'Â® The nature and character\nof the data referred to by Drs. Green and Guyer would seem to necessitate a call  \nfor forward-thinking policy\nresearch and guidance. New policy approaches will be needed to establish a \nsystem that promotes\nappropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data and valid reports while \nencouraging innovation.\nWGS's rapid transition to clinical use has prompted a wide range of initiatives,  \nincluding NIHâ s National Genter \nfor Advancing Translational Sciences,\"* and NHGRIâ s most recent ELSI program \nannouncement, '? and\nheightened the importance of efforts like the FDA and NIH's collaborative \nregulatory science initiative*Â° and the\nGenetic Testing Registry. In June 2011, the FDA held a public meeting to discuss  \napproaches to establish the\nsafety and effectiveness of clinical genomic sequencing. Likewise, insurers and \npharmacy benefits managers\nare creating positions for the management of genomics services.\nThere are numerous policy needs that require the attention of stakeholder groups  \nwith diverse, strong\ninterests in the governance of WGS. Among the many challenges we face are: \nensuring the quality and utility\nof WGS data and interpretation; defining the indications for which WGS should be  \nused; determining whe will\npay for it; developing systems of patents and licensing that maximize access \nwhile rewarding innovation; the\nResearch Strategy Page 102\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n============================================================\nPage 3\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nstorage and integration of data into medical records; issues of ownership and \nprivacy; personnel and training\nneeds; and whether the technology is best used for diagnostic purposes or health  \nscreening.\nWe have organized a research team with expertise in three of these domains: the \noversight of test quality and\nservices; patenting and licensing issues; and the coverage and reimbursement of \nmolecular diagnostics. WGS\nis likely to raise several important questions in each of these areas. How \nshould a WGS test, which could\nsimultaneously produce a result with clear utility, a result with unintended \nconsequences, and a result whose\ninterpretation will change with future research, be categorized under the FDA's \nproposed risk-based approach\nio regulation?â Â° How will insurers address the complexity of the information \ncreated by WGS technology? Will\nthe lack of clinical utility data limit or prevent coverage? Will clinical \nlaboratories be able to offer a camplete\ngenome sequence when some of the genomic landscape is restricted by intellectual  \nproperty patents?*' Are\nlicensing restrictions likely to reduce the utility of the available sequence?\nWith little empiric data available to answer such questions, there is a large \ndegree of uncertainty about the\nnature and relative importance of these policy domains. However there is an \nimmediate need for critical\nthought about what the policy priorities are and how we may begin to address \nthem.\nIn the absence of data about the validity, accuracy or utility of WGS, or how \nstrong the enforcement of patent\nclaims against WGS laboratories will we will develop a set of policy priorities \nfor clinical WGS by consulting a\ndiverse group of stakeholders, including WGS technology and informatics \ncompanies, clinical laboratories,\nhealth care professionals, insurers, regulatory and public health agencies, \nhealth economists, and patient\ngroups. The findings of this study will be driven primarily by the experiences \nand opinions of experts who are\ncurrently developing, monitoring and regulating the tools and technology for the  \nclinical use of WGS\nA modified Delphi process will be to elicit expert stakeholdersâ  input on all \nrelevant policy issues and their\nrelative importance and tractability. This highly structured approach to \nstakeholder engagement allows a\ngeographically and professionally diverse group of experts to anonymously \nprovide one another with\nquantitative and qualitative feedback about the ideas of others on the panel. \nAnalysis of this feedback can lead\nto a prioritized list of WGS issues as defined by the entire community of \nstakeholders, or a detailed critique of\npolicy options to address a given policy problem. Points of agreement between \nstakeholders and reasons for\ndisagreement can be identified. To ensure that this work is based on an \nunderstanding of the actual\ncapabilities and business models of WGS companies, we will begin by conducting \nthe first U.S-centered\nlandscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing an the generation, \ndelivery, and interpretation of\ngenomic data. Throughout the course of the study we will distribute our findings  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nin concise formats that are\naccessible to policymakers.\nConducting policy planning now, as this rapidly-advancing technology begins to \nmature, presents an\nopporiunity to evaluate and influence both the industry and policy options. This  \nwork will help to ensure that\npolicymakers have sound access to existing evidence and policy options based on \nwide-ranging expert\nopinions and rigorous research. A significant portion of the impact of this \nproject will come from active efforts to\ndisseminate our findings to policymakers in order to stimulate discussion and \ninform efforts to enact\nappropriate regulatory reform.\nB. Innovation\n[[This proposal is innovative in four ways. First, it will be one of the first \ncomprehensive projects to\nsystematically assess U.S. policy needs since whole genome sequencing (WGS) has \nbecome available for\nclinical use.'*'Â° Conducting policy work now, just as WGS is becoming \nclinically available and before this\nrapidly-advancing technology matures, will allow us to consider policy questions  \nas they arise in real time, and\noffers the prospect of influencing the early practices and expectations of those  \ninvolved with clinical WGS. Ta\ndate, policy work related to the clinical use of WGS has been largely \ntheoretical. Our propased policy analysis\nis innovative in that it is based on direct engagement with WGS campanies and \nother key stakeholders. This\nwill ensure a forward-looking description of the WGS industry, and the \nproduction of policy priorities and\napproaches that are grounded in a broad range of highly relevant experiences. ]]\nResearch Strategy Page 103\n============================================================\nPage 4\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nSecond, most policy work to date has focused on issues primarily related to \nsingle gene testing and is typically\nlimited to a single policy domain. This proposal explores and prioritizes the \nmast pressing policy questions\nacross three major areas: quality assurance, reimbursement, and patents and \nlicensing. The breadth and\ndepth of the project staff's expertise facilitates the simultaneous development \nof policy approaches in these\ndomains. By disseminating the policy priorities, we hope to stimulate the \ndevelopment of policy approaches\namong experts in other areas such as equitable access to services, privacy, and \ndata access and storage.\n[[Third, we propose using an innovative modified Delphi approach to ensure the \nsystematic incorporation of a\nwide range of highly relevant perspectives in our priority setting and policy \ndevelopment. Members of the\nstakeholder panel anonymously review and propose revisions to other panel \nmembers' ideas as the study\nprogresses. The results are conclusions that have been vetted from many \ndifferent perspectives at a high level.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of each policy approach, as viewed by the range of \nstakeholders will be of\ntremendous value as policymakers and stakeholders begin earnest discussions to \nguide the implementation of\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nW6GS. lf the Delphi process is successful and productive, it could result in the  \nestablishment of a framework,\nor methodological pipeline, to evaluate additional WGS policy issues moving \nforward.]]\nFinally, the direct dissemination of findings to the policy community will \nincrease the uptake and use of this\nwork. Washington-based policy briefings, issue briefs, and online media tools \nwill be used to distribute our\nlandscape analysis, policy priorities, policy approaches, and an account of the \nDelphi process. The expertise of\nBurness Communications will help to ensure the success of our outreach efforts.\nC. Approach\nWe plan to combine straightforward methods of landscape and policy analysis with  \na modified Delphi process,\nin which a diverse panel of key stakeholders are iteratively surveyed for their \nopinions and feedback, to\nsystematically identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\nto develop policy approaches to address the most pressing, tractable issues, as \njudged by our\nstakeholder panel. As with all policy analysis, the first step is to identify \nand clearly define the process being\ngoverned and the nature of the issues that need to be addressed. We will begin \nin Aim 1 by conducting the\nfirst systematic, landscape analysis of the current WGS industry to clearly \ndefine the business methods and\nservices involved in that are being employed to commercialize clinical WGS. To \ninform the development of\nforward-thinking policy, and gain first-hand knowledge of emerging business \nmodels, we will interview\nindustry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS. This innovative, \ncomprehensive landscape\nanalysis will provide a framework for identifying and prioritizing novel policy \nquestions, outlining policy-\nrelevant aspects of the WGS industry including self-imposed quality standards, \ncapabilities and services\nbeing offered, targeted indications and markets, patents held and health claims \nbeing made. This\nassessment of the industry's approaches to clinical sequencing will directly \ninform the development and\nprioritization of major policy issues related to WGS in Aim 2.\n[[In Aim 2 we will engage a diverse panel of experts to define and prioritize \nmajor policy issues related to\nWGS. A preliminary list of policy questions will be generated from the landscape  \nanalysis and our\nknowledge of current standards and policy. We will use a modified Delphi process  \nto systematically collect\nand integrate the opinions of ~40 key stakeholders. A modified Delphi process \nadds an in-person meeting\nof stakeholders and project staff to the traditional process of iterative \nstakeholder surveys.â  The \nstakeholder panel will be drawn from the WGS industry, including WGS technolagy \ncompanies, infarmatics\ncompanies, trade associations, and clinical laboratories; the health care \nsystem, including public and private\ninsurers, pharmacy benefits managers, healthcare systems, provider groups, \nprofessional associations,\nclinical geneticists, and genetic counselors; and policymakers, academics and \nthe public, including\nregulatory and public health agencies (FDA, FTC, CMS, HHS, PTO, CDC, Congress), \nhealth economists,\npatient groups, and intellectual property expert.***? Stakehalders will be \niteratively surveyed (see Figure 1).\nThe results of each survey will be summarized and analyzed by project staff, and  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nreturned ta the panel\nmembers for criticism and comment in the following round. A final in-person \nmeeting will be used to gather\nmore detailed opinions about policy approaches to three high priority questions \nThis process will result in\nthree products: (1) a prioritized list of policy questions for consideration by \nthe policy community, (2) policy\napproaches developed to address three of the most pressing issues as defined by \nthe panel, and {3} a\nsummary of the Delphi process as a technique for developing these approaches. \nThe policy priorities and\nResearch Strategy Page 104\n============================================================\nPage 5\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nthe resulting set of draft approaches will be disseminated in a timely and \naccessible fashion to federal and\nsiate regulators, genome technology developers, investors, health care \nproviders, and other stakeholder\ngroups in Aim 3.]] A preliminary list of stakeholders is found in the Appendix.\nThis project will leverage the expertise, insight, and working relationships \nestablished by an accomplished\nstudy team and a diverse panel of stakeholders to efficiently and \ncomprehensively collect and analyze\ninformation relevant to WGS policy decisions. In this section we describe: (1) \nthe research team and expert\nadvisory board; (2) the research plan and timeline; (3) potential limitations of  \nthe study; and (4} a brief\nsummary of relevant preliminary work.\nC.1 Research team and advisory board\nThe research team will be led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, who combine \nsignificant expertise\nin genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics with extensive experience \nengaging stakeholders and developing\nand disseminating policy options.*** Analysis of the oversight of WGS quality \nwill be led by Gail Javitt, one of\nthe nationâ s foremost experts on FDA law and CMS/CLIA regulation of genetic \ntesting quality and utility. Ms.\nJavitt led the Genetic Testing Quality Initiative at the Genetics and Public \nPolicy Center, which identified gaps\nin federal oversight of single-gene genetic test quality and delivered \nrecommendations to policymakers using a\nwide variety of formats. More recently she published recommendations for a \nblueprint of a genetic test\nregistryÂ®â  and led the GPPC effort to evaluate the policy implications of DTC   \ngenetic testing.â  This proposal \nbuilds on Ms. Javitt's prior work by applying her detailed knowledge of the \nregulatory bodies that have\njurisdiction over genetic testing to quality assurance issues raised by next-\ngeneration sequencing methods with\ndifferent standards, data output, reports and error rates.\nIssues of intellectual property, technology transfer, and relevant aspects of \npolicy engagement will be\naddressed by Robert Gook-Deegan, who is the director of the Duke University \nCenter for Genome Ethics, Law\n& Policy, and a leading expert on the effects of patents and licensing practices  \non genetic testing. Since 2009,\nDr. Gook-Deegan has published an extensive number of peer-reviewed articles \nrelated to human gene\n\n--- Page 8 ---\npatenting. Among his many contributions to the field are patent case studies \nthat served as the basis for the\n2010 SAGGHS Report on Gene Patents and Licensing Practices and Their Impact on \nPatient Access to\nGenetic Tests. The study will extend his work to consider policy approaches to \npatent and licensing issues\npresented by clinical applications of WGS.\nSean Tunis, Pat Deverka, and Donna Messner of the Center for Medical Technology \nPolicy (CMTP}) in\nBaltimore, MD, will address issues of insurance coverage and reimbursement \npolicies for WGS. As founder\nand Director of GMTP, Dr. Tunis is a recognized leader in the assessment of \nmedical technologies, including\nmolecular diagnostics, and the development of guidance for insurance coverage of  \nthese tools. As the Chief\nMedical Officer at CMS, he supervised the development of national coverage \npolicies and quality standards for\nthe adoption of new technologies by Medicare and Medicaid providers. He is \njoined by Dr. Deverka, an expert\nin the identification of policy approaches to improve the clinical translation \nof personalized medicine. At CMTP,\nDr. Deverka is currently engaging stakeholders on several projects related to \npersonalized medicine which use\nDelphi panels and other methods to set priorities for care. [[Dr. Messner is a \nspecialist in qualitative social\nresearch methods, including stakeholder engagement methodologies and use of the \nDelphi process to gather\nopinions on topics including FDA regulation, genetic testing, and gene \npatenting. Dr. Messner will lead the\nselection of the stakeholder panel and development of the Delphi process. ]]\nIn addition, an eight-member expert advisory board will provide guidance \nthroughout the project. [This advisary\nboard is distinct from the key stakeholder panel (Delphi panel) that we will \nengage in the Delphi pracess; its\nfunction is to serve as a sounding board for project staff, and to advise the \nproject on dissemination of\nfindings]. Letters of agreement for the advisory board members are attached. \nAdvisory board members\ninclude: Jim Evans, a physician and molecular biologist at the University of \nNorth Carolina School of Medicine,\nand Director of UNC's Clinical Cancer Genetics Services; George Church, an \ninnovator in genome sequencing\ntechnology and the Director of the Center for Computational Genetics and the \nPersonal Genome Project, and\nfounder of Knome Inc; Dietrich Stephan, the co-founder of Navigenics and a \npioneer in the development cf\nnew business models for genetic testing; Arti Rai, a renowned legal scholar at \nDuke University who served as\ndirector of external relations for the US Patent and Trademark Office; [[David \nVeenstra, an associate professor\nResearch Strategy Page 105\n============================================================\nPage 6\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nof pharmaceutical outcomes research at the University of Washington and an \nestablished scholar on the\neconomic implications of pharmacogenomics; Sarah Botha, an attorney in the \nBureau of Cansumer Protection\nat the Federal Trade Commission where she has focused on consumersâ  legal \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nrights and protections when\npurchasing genetic tests; Jonathan Rothberg, the founder and CEO of 454 Life \nSciences and lon Torrent, two\nof the largest companies responsible for current advances in sequencing \ntechnology; and Heidi Williams, an\nAssistant Professor of Economics at MIT where she is an expert on the economics \nof innovation in genome-\nrelated markets. ]]\nThe advisory board will meet five times during the course of the study via \nInternet-based video\nteleconierencing to minimize travel expense and burden. The first meeting at the  \noutset of the study will clarify\nstudy goals. At the second meeting the research team will present WGS landscape \nanalysis and discuss\nrelevant policy questions. In year two the board will help to select three \nissues to develop policy approaches\nfor, based on results from the Delphi process, and define criteria that should \nbe considered when developing\nthe policies. Towards the end of year two, the panel will review the approaches \ndeveloped through the Delphi\nsurveys. Finally, the research team will update the board on major findings, \nsolicit ideas for dissemination, and\ndiscuss plans for future research.

We will include\ncompanies, universities and other entities developing whole genome sequencing \ntechnologies and equipment,\nproviding sequencing services (whole or exomic), or offering clinical annotation  \nor interpretation of sequence\ndata.

We will classify the range \nof business models used to\npromote and deliver WGS based on the policy-relevant information we collect. We \nwill refine and narrow\nResearch Strategy Page 106\n============================================================\nPage 7\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nour definition of WGS companies, eliminating any that are not offering relevant \nproducts or services. The\nlandscape report will include sections identifying the companies, the service \nmodels for clinical WGS, the\nmarkets being addressed, and who is paying for the services.\n[Interviews with industry leaders: WGS business models and technologies are \nchanging rapidly. To anticipate\nthese developments as we draft policy approaches, project staff at GPPC will \nconduct semi-structured\ninterviews with a purposive sample of up to 20 industry leaders to seek their \nperspectives on the future of\nclinical WGS. Interviews will not ask leaders about specific business plans, as \nthis information is unlikely to be\ndivulged. We will recruit chief executives and senior scientific and business \nofficers from companies identified\nin the landscape analysis. Recruitment will cease when saturation of interview \nfindings occurs or 20 interviews\nare completed. Based on GPPC and CMTP's experience recruiting scientists and \nprofessional stakeholders for\nother interview studies, we believe we will be able to enroll 20 individuals \nfrom what we expect will be at least\n40 companies with at least three eligible staff each.\nAn interview guide will be drafted, piloted among advisory board members, and \nrevised. The guide will contain\na small number of general questions designed to evoke a conversational tone and \nelicit opinions about the\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nfuture directions of clinical WGS. Questions might include how participants \nthink WGS is most likely to be\nintegrated into care, or what companies need to do to prepare for the many \npossible clinical uses of WGS. We\nwill also use this opportunity to collect information about industry standards \nand self-regulatian. Telephone\ninterviews lasting 30-40 minutes will be audio taped using two recording devices  \nto prevent data loss. All\ninterview materials will be de-identified and kept confidential; no data will be  \nreported on the individual level.\nTapes will be transcribed. After all personal identifiers are deleted, \ntranscripts will be entered into the\nqualitative data analysis software NVivo version 9.0. We will apply an \nabbreviated content/thematic analysis to\nassimilate the interview data: a fairly simple coding scheme will be applied to \ncode transcripts for major themes\nrelated to the future of clinical WGS {e.g., \"emerging business modelsâ  or \nâ pathways to clinical integration\").\nThe entire research team will meet to review the coded transcripts, discuss the \nthemes that emerged, and\nintegrate the findings into the landscape analysis.\nEffective evaluation of the policy and oversight implications of WGS will \nrequire careful, ongoing monitoring of\nthe industry throughout the study to identify new entrants into the marketplace.  \nThroughout the course of the\nstudy we will search for emerging companies and business models, and we will \ndocument changes in existing\nWGS companies by regularly collecting screen shots of Web sites showing test \nofferings and changes in\nservices.]]\nffC.3 Aim 2: Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nthat iteratively engages key stakeholders. [[Note to reviewers: this Aim is new \nand replaces a more\ntraditional policy analysis.j}\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty about how whole genome sequencing will be \nincorporated into clinical\nmedicine, both generally and in the United Statesâ  healthcare complex. There \nis a general consensus that\nwhole genome sequencing will disrupt the patchwork of systems that currently \nguide clinical single-gene\ntesting and newborn screening, including existing codes and policies for \nreimbursement and insurance\ncoverage, appropriate indications for testing, standards to ensure genetic test \nquality, and intellectual\nproperty rights.

The buy-in of these \norganizations, aur interviews with\nindustry leaders in Aim 1, our dissemination of the landscape analysis to \npolicymakers (Aim 3),and the\npresence of industry and thought leaders on the advisory panel will all serve as  \ncatalysts for additional\nrecruitment. ]]\nPreparation of the Delphi Panel and Delphi Materials: Maintaining panel \nmembersâ  anonymity in their \nSurvey responses encourages unconventional or unexpected ideas and questions.*Â°  \nHence, each panel\nmember will be assigned a two letter code that panel members and study staff \nwill use to refer to each\nother during the surveys.â * However, complete anonymity can undermine the \nprocess; participants need\nconfidence that their fellow participants are respected peers. A brief group \nbuilding exercise will be\nconducted at the outset to develop this confidence. Panel members will be asked \nto submit their names,\n\n--- Page 14 ---\naffiliations, and areas of expertise, as well as their concerns and hopes for \nthe Delphi process. A summary\nof this information will be disseminated to all participants. Panel members will  \nalso be sent the landscape\nanalysis from Aim 1, which will provide important context for the identification  \nand consideration of policy\nquestions. The initial surveys for both problem identification and the \ndevelopment of policy approaches will\nbe carefully developed ahead of time by staff and piloted with advisory board \nmembers. Instruments for the\nlater rounds will be determined by the panel responses.\nIdentification and prioritization of novel policy questions posed by WGS: The \nstakeholder panel and project\nStaff will engage in two rounds of input to clearly identify and prioritize \nunique policy questions related to the\nclinical use of WGS. Prior to the first round of the Delphi process, the entire \nstudy team, in consultation with\nthe advisory board, will use our landscape analysis and our knowledge of current  \nstandards and policy to\ndevelop a preliminary list of novel policy questions we believe are raised by \nclinical WGS. This â straw \nmodelâ  of policy questions will be submitted to panel members for \nconsideration as the first survey.\nParticipants will be asked to review the issues, add issues, comment on any \nissues they wish, and rate the\nimportance, validity, and technical and political feasibility of addressing each  \nissue using 5-point Likert\nscales.â \"' The use of these scales does not exclude other forms of \nclassification of the policy questions;\nwe will consider the findings of our landscape analysis and recommendations of \nthe advisory panel to\nidentify other measures by which these questions might be categorized.\nThe team will assess and summarize the responses. The resulting annotated list \nof policy questions will be\npresented back to the panel, who will use a second online survey to review the \nissues, make additional\ncomments, and again rate the importance, validity, and technical and political \nfeasibility of addressing each\nissue. The feedback will be summarized to produce an annotated list of policy \nquestions. The questions will\nbe prioritized using the ranked scale data. Numerical values for importance and \nvalidity will be summed to\nform a \"Priority\" scale ranging from 0 to 8, while values for technical \nfeasibility will be summed to form a\n\"Tractabilityâ  scale ranging from 0 to 8. An Overall scale summing all four \nitems (range 0-16) will also be\ntallied. Median values for the individual and combined scales will be calculated  \nfor each policy question.\nNumerical priority rankings will be computed after sorting the list of questions  \nby median Overall rating, then\nPriority. A second list of ratings will be computed, sorting by Overall rating \nfollowed by Tractability. An\nannotated, ranked, sortable list of priorities with median values of each \ncomposite and individual scale will\nbe published and disseminated in a variety of formats to the broader stakeholder  \ncommunities to inform the\ndevelopment of WGS-related policy.\nResearch Strategy Page 109\n============================================================\nPage 10\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nDevelopment of multiple policy approaches to address the most pressing, \ntractable issues in our areas of\nexpertise: The goal of generating policy approaches is to provide policymakers \nand others with several\nalternatives to address policy needs for the effective integration of WGS. \nIdeally, alternative approaches vary in\nterms of timing, mechanism, distribution of burden, extent of federal and state \ngovernment involvement, and\nstakeholder support. The second round of the Delphi process will be used to \ndevelop approaches that might\nnot have emerged from a less structured stakeholder conversation that could be \nled or dominated by members\nwith particular viewpoints. The process will also provide a detailed \nunderstanding of where various factions\nconverge and diverge, and the nature of disagreements. These data help to \nidentify aspects of policy that will\nrequire negotiation and compromise.\nSelection of the policy questions to address: We have organized a team with \nexpertise in three policy areas\nidentified by the program announcement as important to the success of clinical \nWGS - analytic validity and\ntesting quality (GPPC), patenting and licensing (Duke}, and reimbursement and \npayment (CMTP}. We will\naddress the most important, tractable issue identified by the panel in each of \nthese three categories. We\nrecognize that the panel will identity several important issues that lie outside  \nof these domains, and we will\nencourage others with appropriate expertise to take up the development of \npolicies to address them. We\nwill consult the advisory board on our choice of issues.\nAnalysis of the current legal and requlatory framework surrounding the three \nselected issues: Each policy\ngroup (GPP, Duke, and GMPT) will prepare an initial evaluation of the current \nfederal and state laws and\nregulations, [[professional and association guidelines, and standards being \nadopted by the WGSj] industry that\napply to the issues being addressed. We will consider the intended purpose of \nthese rules, whether they are\nboth broad and precise enough to address the policy issues being considered. We \nalso will examine whether\nand by whom compliance with existing laws is enforced. Finally, we will \ndetermine whether there are conflicts\nor redundancies between different Jaws and guidelines that may need to be \nresolved. These analyses will be\nwritten up into white papers and disseminated to pane] members to provide them \nwith context for the\ndevelopment of policy approaches. Drs. McGuire and Kaufman will coordinate the \nefforts of the three teams\nfo ensure that they produce comparable evaluations that can be combined and \nexamined together.\nThroughout the study, regular project meetings involving all key staff will be \nconducted to ensure timely\nprogress, as well as comparable goals and products among the different teams.\nDevelopment a range of potential policy approaches: To begin developing policy \nalternatives, Delphi panel\nmembers will be asked to â brainstormâ  in response to the third survey  \nconsisting of open-ended questions\nabout how best to address the three policy issues. Panelists will be asked to \nconsider the landscape of the\nindustry and the current policy environment as well as more specific outcomes \nsuch as the impact on public\nhealth, cost implications for the government and stakeholders, and the impact on  \naccess to WGS and other\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nservices. Additional criteria for consideration may also be identified. The \nproject team will simultaneously\nouiline its own policy approaches using the policy analysis framework developed \nby Patton & Sawicki.*?\nCombining stakeholder input with the project teamâ s approaches, we will \nprepare a straw model of policy\nalternatives to address each issue. Following the policy Delphi approach of,â *  \nthe straw model will take the\nform of a series of resolutions and arguments supporting each resolution.

The staff will \"moderateâ  the discussion by feeding mean and \nmedian rankings, comments and\nsuggestions back to panel members for a final survey to collect rankings and \nfeedback. The staff will\ncambine and summarize comments in the case of identical arguments.\nBefore disseminating the policy approaches more broadly, we will review our \nfindings at an in-person\nmeeting of the Delphi panel members and project staff.

Below, I provide an NIH-style peer review per the Two-Agent NIH Grant Review Framework, using your extracted grant document. All evaluations are explicitly grounded in proposal evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not Provided: Systematic Policy Prioritization for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing]\n**PI:** [David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, Leads]  \n**Mechanism:** [Not Specified, presumed R01 based on scope]\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)  \n**Focus:** Significance and Innovation\n\n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis proposal addresses a critical, timely gap in genomic medicine as clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) rapidly approaches routine use. The challenge of integrating WGS into clinical care—given current policy limitations in oversight, reimbursement, and intellectual property—remains unresolved, with significant implications for clinical utility, health outcomes, equitable access, and innovation. The proposed systematic analysis, which includes a comprehensive landscape assessment and an expert-driven (Delphi-based) policy prioritization, represents a methodologically innovative approach to anticipating and shaping the regulatory framework. Unlike previous theoretical or single-domain analyses, the project targets broad, real-time policy gaps across three major domains, ensuring direct relevance for federal and stakeholder decision-makers. This breadth and the strong stakeholder engagement increase its significance.\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)  \n**Focus:** Scientific approach, design, reproducibility, inclusion, and feasibility\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe methodology is clearly described, coupling systematic landscape analysis with structured qualitative interviews and a modified Delphi process to ensure relevance, breadth, and methodological transparency. The Delphi approach—including multiple iterative online surveys and an in-person summit—systematically captures and refines expert and stakeholder input, reducing bias and enhancing validity. Inclusion is robust, with stakeholders explicitly drawn from industry, clinical, regulatory, payor, and advocacy domains. Ethical handling of human subjects is considered (anonymity, confidentiality). The anticipated deliverables (white papers, policy recommendations, dissemination strategies) are feasible within the described timeline and resource context, leveraging substantial prior experience. One limitation is the lack of preliminary data on the actionable impact of Delphi-derived priorities on actual policy uptake, but the thorough planning mitigates this risk.\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)  \n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe leadership team combines recognized domain expertise in relevant areas (genomics policy, legal/regulatory, clinical translation, health economics, qualitative methods). The inclusion of an accomplished advisory board and buy-in from major stakeholder organizations further strengthens technical and contextual capacity. Institutional support is apparent via referenced collaboration with Burness Communications and expert centers (Duke, CMTP, etc.), supporting both project execution and national outreach.\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA (Affect Impact but Not Scored)  \n**Human Subjects:**  \nInvolves interviews with professionals and stakeholders; protections for anonymity and confidentiality are robust and appropriate.\n\n**Vertebrate Animals:**  \nNot Applicable.\n\n**Biohazards:**  \nNot Applicable.\n\n**Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:**  \nNot specified; presented as a new submission with iterative adaptation in design (“Note to reviewers: this Aim is new…”).\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS (Do Not Affect Score)  \n**Authentication of Key Resources:**  \nNot directly applicable, as the work is policy- and consultation-based; references standardized approaches to data management (e.g., NVivo, survey methods) and stakeholder validation.\n\n**Budget and Period of Support:**  \nNot described in extracted text, but timeline and deliverables appear realistic for a typical R01-scale period (2–3 years).\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)  \n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**   \nThis proposal delivers substantial strengths in significance and feasibility. The question of how to govern clinical WGS is rapidly escalating in importance, and the proposed methods are uniquely suited to generate timely, actionable policy guidance grounded in broad sectoral expertise. The innovative use of a modified Delphi process and systematic landscape analysis, coupled with a strong interdisciplinary team and advisory structure, position the project to exert a powerful, sustained influence on both policy and practice. Weaknesses are minor and primarily relate to general uncertainties about downstream policy adoption, not to the design or execution of the research itself. The project is likely to have a transformative impact on regulatory science for genomics.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:**  \nNIH_gpt_4.1 – AI Assistant  \nFor Dr. Blake Dickerson\n\n(If you wish, I can now serve as Critic/Agent B, or address any additional review sections or questions.)",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_gpt_4.1, your AI assistant. Below is a comprehensive, section-by-section NIH peer review analysis of the provided grant proposal, employing the formal NIH criteria, scoring conventions (1=exceptional, 9=poor), and an evidence-based, constructive tone.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overall Impact\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe proposal addresses a timely and urgent need, aiming to develop empirically informed policy frameworks to guide the clinical integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS). It leverages a systematic landscape analysis and a robust, multi-stakeholder Delphi process. The assembled team is highly qualified, encompassing legal, clinical, economic, and regulatory expertise, and the design is well-structured with clearly defined aims, milestones, and deliverables. Immediate and broad dissemination efforts to policy-makers further enhance its potential national impact.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThe proposal’s impact is contingent upon effective translation of prioritized policy recommendations into actual regulatory or clinical change, which is not guaranteed by study design alone. There is limited discussion on metrics or strategies for evaluating long-term uptake or influence of the proposed guidelines beyond dissemination.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nTo strengthen overall impact, integrate a clear evaluation plan for follow-up on policy adoption and real-world changes resulting from the work. Consider specifying mechanisms for ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and major payors after dissemination to increase prospects for implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Significance\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe project targets a well-articulated and formidable gap in the governance of clinical genomics—namely, the inability of current regulatory frameworks to keep pace with WGS. The application directly addresses multiple acute challenges: test quality oversight, reimbursement, and patent/licensing. Early policy intervention at this juncture could dramatically influence health outcomes, equity, and innovation in genomic medicine. The work aligns with explicit NIH program priorities and directly integrates needs articulated in recent NHGRI and ELSI program calls.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nWhile the proposal highlights the breadth of significance, some downstream benefits (e.g., improved patient outcomes or actual policy reform) are inferred rather than empirically justified, and potential overlap with parallel policy efforts is not deeply explored.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nArticulate more explicitly how the project’s outcomes could be measured or linked to tangible, downstream benefits (even if indirectly). Provide additional discussion on complementarity and differentiation from existing or concurrent regulatory initiatives.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Investigators\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe PIs and core team demonstrate outstanding expertise across genomic science, policy, law, and health services research. Specific mention is made of individual leaders in FDA regulatory law, gene patent policy, and clinical reimbursement, each with extensive prior contributions. Advisory and stakeholder panels draw from a broad cross-section of influential thought leaders (e.g., directors of national centers, legal scholars, health economists, clinical leaders). Letters of support and past successful collaborations evidence the team’s ability to recruit and coordinate a top-flight group.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThe proposal relies heavily on senior staff for leadership of major sub-aims. There is little detail regarding the mentorship, training or involvement of early-career investigators or staff within the project structure.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nDescribe specific plans for mentoring or capacity-building for junior team members or associated trainees. Highlight how junior investigators might be meaningfully involved in data collection, analysis, or dissemination, which will also foster field sustainability.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Innovation\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe proposal is highly innovative in both method and scope. Notably, it applies the modified Delphi process—anonymously iterating among a diverse, balanced panel—to policy development in an area notoriously marked by entrenched interests and missing empirical data. The project is also one of the first to systematically integrate perspectives from the full WGS industry, rather than focusing on single-gene or more traditional regulatory issues. The aim to create a publicly available, living resource (landscape analysis and priority framework) for ongoing policy work is also novel.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nInnovation is somewhat offset by the lack of preliminary evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the Delphi process in effecting policy change in similarly complex, multi-stakeholder settings.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nAdd references to successes of the Delphi approach in analogous policy fields, or describe pilot experience the team may have with this process. Consider supplementing the Delphi with a brief, alternative engagement (e.g., public comment period) to triangulate findings.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Approach\n\n**SCORE:** 3\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe approach is comprehensive and methodologically sound, combining landscape analysis, qualitative interviews, and iterative Delphi surveying with an in-person forum for consensus building. The proposal details recruitment, panel composition, survey development, anonymity strategies, data management, and analytic methods (NVivo, validated scales). Potential limitations and risks (e.g., panel attrition, disagreement, recruitment challenges) are addressed, and prior experience with similar panels increases feasibility. The cross-domain focus (quality, intellectual property, reimbursement) ensures broad applicability of the outputs.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nWhile the plan for gathering and analyzing input is strong, the mechanisms for how conflicting recommendations or persistent disagreements among stakeholders will be resolved or prioritized are only briefly addressed. Furthermore, the strategy for updating the landscape analysis after project completion is not fully defined.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nExpand on plans for managing major disagreements among panel members, including criteria for prioritization in the case of persistent division. Clarify whether and how the landscape resource will be maintained or updated beyond this project period (e.g., committing to annual updates or transitioning stewardship to a public resource center).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Environment\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe principal investigators are based at leading institutions with demonstrated support for interdisciplinary science and stakeholder engagement (Duke, Baylor, CMTP, Burness Communications). The proposal describes deep collaboration with these institutions, leveraging extensive networks and communications infrastructure. Institutional commitment to dissemination and stakeholder outreach is clear.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThere is minimal discussion of contingency plans in the event that access to particular stakeholder groups or company representatives is hindered (e.g., companies unwilling to share information, staff turnover).\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nDetail alternative strategies for securing engagement from all targeted sectors, such as drawing on parallel networks, rotating membership, or leveraging endorsements from national societies/organizations to encourage participation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Assessment\n\nThis is a highly impactful, timely proposal that addresses a critical gap in clinical genomics policy. The project combines empirical rigor with policy-relevance and innovation, leveraging the Delphi process and a multidisciplinary team to produce actionable, stakeholder-driven guidance. The investigators are leaders in their fields, and the overall environment is highly supportive. Weaknesses are moderate and center on strengthening downstream implementation, mechanisms for managing disagreement, and broader stakeholder access. Addressing these would further enhance the considerable impact the project is positioned to have in shaping the regulatory landscape for clinical whole genome sequencing.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \nTo further strengthen the application, the investigators should: (1) articulate clear strategies for post-project evaluation and engagement to increase the likelihood of adoption; (2) expand on conflict management among stakeholders; (3) enhance capacity-building among junior investigators; (4) ensure resource sustainability; and (5) elaborate on stakeholder recruitment contingency approaches. These refinements would reinforce the project’s outstanding potential for national leadership in genomics policy.\n\n---\n\nIf you wish, I am available to elaborate on any section or draft sample summary statements.",

Below is my critical assessment identifying vulnerabilities and areas requiring improvement.\n\n---\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:\n\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n1. **Score-Justification Mismatch**: The reviewer awards an exceptionally high score (2) but provides insufficient evidence from the proposal text to justify this near-exceptional rating. The justification relies heavily on general assertions about WGS importance rather than specific evidence of how THIS proposal uniquely addresses the gap.\n\n2. **Vague Innovation Claims**: The review states the approach is \"methodologically innovative\" but fails to explain what makes a Delphi process innovative in this context, as Delphi methods are standard in policy research.\n\n3. **Missing Specific Aims**: The review does not quote or reference specific aims from the proposal, making it impossible to assess whether the score accurately reflects the proposal's actual objectives.\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:\n\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n1. **Contradictory Scoring Logic**: The reviewer identifies a significant limitation (\"lack of preliminary data on actionable impact\") yet still awards a very strong score (3). This inconsistency suggests the score may be inflated.\n\n2. **Insufficient Methodological Detail**: The review mentions \"systematic landscape analysis\" and \"structured qualitative interviews\" but provides no evidence of sample sizes, power calculations, or specific analytical frameworks from the proposal.\n\n3. **Feasibility Assumptions**: The reviewer assumes feasibility based on \"substantial prior experience\" without citing specific preliminary data or pilot studies from the proposal text.\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:\n\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n1. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: The review makes broad claims about \"recognized domain expertise\" without citing specific investigators' qualifications, publication records, or relevant prior grants from the proposal.\n\n2. **Vague Institutional Support**: References to \"Duke, CMTP, etc.\" are too general—specific facilities, cores, or institutional commitments should be detailed.\n\n### Additional Criteria:\n\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n1. **Human Subjects Section Too Brief**: Given that interviews are central to the methodology, the human subjects protection discussion is inadequately detailed. IRB approval status, recruitment procedures, and data security measures should be addressed.\n\n2. **Budget Assessment Missing**: The reviewer acknowledges not having budget information but still concludes the timeline is \"realistic\"—this is contradictory and unprofessional.\n\n### Overall Impact:\n\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n1. **Score Inflation**: An overall impact score of 2 (high impact) seems inconsistent with the identified weaknesses and missing information throughout the review.\n\n2. **Speculative Impact Claims**: The assertion of \"transformative impact on regulatory science\" lacks grounding in specific deliverables or dissemination plans from the proposal.\n\n3. **Missing Proposal Title and Grant Mechanism**: These fundamental elements should not be listed as \"[Not Provided]\" or \"presumed\"—they must be extracted from the actual proposal.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis review exhibits several critical flaws:\n- **Insufficient Evidence**: Nearly every section lacks specific citations from the proposal text\n- **Score Inflation**: Scores appear systematically high given the identified weaknesses\n- **Missing Key Information**: Title, mechanism, budget, and specific aims are absent\n- **Logical Inconsistencies**: Acknowledging major limitations while awarding high scores\n- **NIH Convention Violations**: Using brackets for missing information rather than extracting from the proposal\n\n**Recommended Improvements:**\n1. Extract and cite specific text from the proposal for every claim\n2. Recalibrate scores to reflect identified weaknesses (likely 4-5 range)\n3. Provide complete proposal identification information\n4. Expand human subjects and methodological rigor discussions\n5. Remove speculative statements about impact without proposal evidence\n\nThis review requires substantial revision to meet NIH peer review standards.\n\n---\n\nRespectfully submitted,  \nNIH_claude_opus4 - AI Assistant",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nThank you for sharing NIH_claude_opus4’s detailed critique. I will methodically reflect on each major point, specify how I will address them, and provide a revised review that strictly adheres to NIH conventions and standards, with clear evidence citations from the provided proposal text.\n\n---\n\n## Reflection and Response to Critique\n\n**1. Score-Justification Alignment and Use of Specific Evidence**  \n*Critique*: Scores were high without commensurate, granular evidence from the actual proposal; missing direct references to Aims and proposal text.\n*Response*: Agree. My prior review was not sufficiently granular. The revised response will directly cite and reference proposal language, especially the Specific Aims section and project descriptions, grounding every strength or weakness in explicit evidence.\n\n**2. Innovation and Delphi Process**  \n*Critique*: Stated “innovation” of Delphi is not sufficiently explained; this is a standard method.\n*Response*: Agree. I will clarify that the Delphi process is a classic method, but will reference how the PI integrates it distinctively or where the proposal acknowledges limitations of standard approaches and seeks novelty.\n\n**3. Clarity on Specific Aims and Identifiers**  \n*Critique*: The previous review missed basic information—proposal title, grant mechanism, and direct quoting/paraphrasing of Aims.\n*Response*: Agree. The revised review will use the “Specific Aims” text, and I will reconstruct the project title and mechanism as best supported by the document.\n\n**4. Rigor, Feasibility, and Method Detail**  \n*Critique*: Lack of sample detail, insufficient description of analytic approach, unjustified feasibility assumptions.\n*Response*: I concur. I will extract details on panel sizes, analytic plans (e.g., Likert scaling, content analysis), timeline, and recruitment from the proposal text and clearly state any missing details as limitations.\n\n**5. Expertise/Resources**  \n*Critique*: Lacks concrete evidence of expertise and institutional commitment.\n*Response*: Agree. I will reference named investigators, their roles, and capacities as described in the Research Strategy, and expand on institutional contexts.\n\n**6. Human Subjects and Budget**  \n*Critique*: Too brief a discussion of human subjects; realistic feasibility assessments are questionable without budget details.\n*Response*: I agree detailed protections and procedures should be included, based on available language in the proposal. I will make clear note where the budget is missing and avoid declared “realism” absent explicit support.\n\n**7. Overall Impact and Consistency**  \n*Critique*: Score inflation, speculative claims, missing deliverables and overall coherence.\n*Response*: Agree that all impact claims should be explicitly linked to actual proposal outputs and plans. I will recalibrate scores if the weaknesses warrant, citing evidence for each.\n\n---\n\n# Revised NIH-Style Peer Review\n\n**Title:** “Systematic Policy Prioritization and Stakeholder Consultation for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing Integration”  \n**PI:** David Kaufman & Amy McGuire (Leads)  \n**Mechanism:** Not explicitly stated; internal evidence suggests R01 or regular research project grant (see: reference to “Regular Research Program,” “Research Strategy Page 102”).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overall Impact  \n**SCORE:** 4\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThis proposal addresses a critical, timely policy gap: the lack of coordinated oversight, reimbursement, and IP policy around clinical WGS adoption, as explicitly foregrounded in the “Specific Aims” and “Significance” sections. The proposal’s design combines a national industry landscape analysis, a multi-domain modified Delphi panel of ~40 stakeholders, and policy approach generation and dissemination (p. 1–3, 8–10). The investigative team is highly qualified, pooling nationally recognized leaders in regulatory science, patent law, and clinical genomics. Multiple strategies for dissemination to regulators, payors, and policymakers are integrated (e.g., “white papers, briefs, webcasts… two public briefings for Washington-based policymakers,” p. 2).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThe real-world impact—namely, whether stakeholder-derived policy priorities will actually influence regulatory or payer behavior—remains speculative; no concrete post-project adoption or evaluation strategy is described. The project traverses three substantial domains but may not have resources to yield actionable depth in each. Budget, implementation, and longer-term sustainability plans are not described in the available text.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nArticulate a sustained implementation/evaluation plan (e.g., follow-up with regulatory agencies, outcome measures for policy uptake). Specify how each policy domain will be given enough analytic depth within the project timeline and resource envelope. Provide a summary table of planned outputs and responsible parties.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Significance  \n**SCORE:** 3\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe proposal takes on major gaps in current policy: “The current regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing and newborn screening was not designed to integrate WGS into clinical practice… new policy approaches may be required…” (p. 1). The research aligns with explicit priorities described in program announcement PA-11-250 (p. 2), aiming to “establish a system that guarantees appropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data and valid reports while encouraging innovation” (Specific Aims).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nWhile significance is clear, the resulting impact on patient outcomes, system equity, or cost containment is largely inferred rather than concretely projected. There is limited attention to overlap or coordination with similar efforts (e.g., NIH/FDA regulatory science initiatives, recent public meetings—p. 2–3).\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nProvide more direct links between proposed outputs and health/system-level metrics or downstream evaluation. Clarify the proposal’s unique contribution relative to parallel federal efforts (e.g., FDA, NHGRI, CMS).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Investigators  \n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nTeam leadership is clearly articulated: “The research team will be led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, who combine significant expertise in genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics… Analysis of the oversight of WGS quality will be led by Gail Javitt… Issues of intellectual property… by Robert Gook-Deegan… insurance coverage and reimbursement policies for WGS… by Sean Tunis, Pat Deverka, and Donna Messner…” (p. 5). An eight-member expert advisory board provides additional gravitas, with named members from major academic centers and federal agencies (p. 5–6).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThe proposal relies on a comparatively small team for an ambitious scope; delineation of FTE, timelines, and defined roles for junior staff is limited. No explicit mention of staff capacity-building/mentoring.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nClarify specific roles, time commitments, and contingency plans (e.g., for turnover or overload in one domain). Add specific mentorship/training opportunities for early-career staff.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Innovation  \n**SCORE:** 5\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe integration of stakeholder panel engagement across three domains, prior to maturation of the field, is potentially impactful: “policy work related to the clinical use of WGS has been largely theoretical. Our proposed policy analysis is innovative in that it is based on direct engagement…” (p. 4). The combination of real-time landscape analysis and iterative panel engagement is less common.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThe Delphi approach is described as “innovative;” however, this is a well-established method for policy priority-setting. The novelty lies in early timing and cross-domain coverage, rather than in methodological innovation per se.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nReframe statements about “innovation” to emphasize the integration of multiple policy domains and the timing of intervention, rather than over-claiming novelty of methods. Cite any unique pilot findings or integration experiences, if present.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Approach  \n**SCORE:** 4\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe approach is detailed, specifying a 2-stage Delphi process (~40 stakeholders), iterative survey rounds, and an in-person panel for synthesis (p. 6–10). Procedures for recruitment, survey anonymity, Likert scale use for prioritization, and thematic analysis (NVivo for interview data; p. 7) are described.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nQuantitative methodological details are sparse—there is no mention of statistical justification for panel size, nor any analytic framework for final policy ranking, aside from median scoring. Strategies for managing disagreement, potential nonresponse bias, and data integration across domains are not thoroughly explicated. Human subjects protection plans are alluded to (“protections for anonymity and confidentiality…”), but details regarding IRB status, informed consent, or data security are not provided.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nInclude a flow diagram or table justifying sample sizes and analytic approaches. Expand the section on handling panel attrition/disagreement. Provide specifics on human subjects procedures—confirm IRB status, consent framework, and how data will be stored and protected.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Environment  \n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe application details strong institutional affiliations—Baylor College of Medicine (McGuire), Center for Medical Technology Policy (Tunis et al.), Duke Center for Genome Ethics, Law & Policy (Cook-Deegan), and Burness Communications. Explicit letters of support and a history of successful stakeholder engagement projects are cited (p. 5–6). Burness Communications’ involvement strengthens dissemination.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nPhysical and administrative infrastructure for this collaborative, multi-institutional endeavor are not described. Budget, facilities, and contingency access plans for key stakeholders or data sources are not referenced in the provided text.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nProvide specific information regarding space, resources (meeting platforms, data storage), and formal institutional commitments. Articulate contingency plans for stakeholder recruitment difficulties.\n\n---\n\n## Final Summary\n\nThis application directly addresses a central, time-sensitive national health policy gap: systematic, evidence-informed frameworks for the clinical use of whole genome sequencing. The project’s strengths include a highly qualified investigative team, strong institutional connections, timely intervention, and robust stakeholder engagement. Methodological rigor is fair to strong, but certain innovations, statistical details, and human subjects protections remain under-detailed. The real-world impact is credible, but not guaranteed—future success will depend on post-project implementation, stakeholder engagement, and dissemination follow-through. Scores have been recalibrated to reflect these realities, and the review now grounds every strength and weakness in explicit citations from the proposal.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nStrengthen the application with more granular analytic plans, a concrete evaluation/implementation strategy, clear distinction of “innovation,” expanded human subjects protections, and documentation of environment and budget. These steps will materially enhance the likelihood of success and the ability of policy-makers to act on the resulting recommendations.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if any additional clarification or section-specific expansion is needed.",

Please reflect on this feedback and regenerate your response, addressing the valid concerns while explaining why you might disagree with any points you find incorrect:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_claude_opus4, your AI assistant. I have carefully analyzed NIH_gpt_4.1's revised review and identified several critical issues that require attention.\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Factor 1 — Importance of the Research\n\n**Score-Justification Misalignment:**\n- The Significance score of 3 (\"Excellent\") contradicts the stated weaknesses about \"largely inferred\" impact and \"limited attention to overlap\" with other efforts\n- These substantial weaknesses should warrant a score of 4-5 range, not 3\n- The justification lacks concrete evidence of how this work advances beyond existing NIH/FDA initiatives\n\n**Missing Elements:**\n- No clear articulation of the specific knowledge gap being filled\n- Innovation section (score 5) acknowledges the Delphi method is \"well-established,\" yet doesn't justify why a \"Very Good\" score is appropriate for minimal methodological innovation\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility\n\n**Approach Score Inflation (Score: 4):**\n- The review identifies major methodological gaps: \"sparse quantitative details,\" no \"statistical justification for panel size,\" missing \"analytic framework\"\n- These are fundamental rigor issues that should result in a score of 5-6, not 4\n- The absence of human subjects protection details is particularly concerning for a stakeholder engagement study\n\n**Feasibility Concerns:**\n- Timeline feasibility cannot be assessed without seeing the actual project timeline\n- Resource adequacy remains unverified due to missing budget information\n- The \"40 stakeholders across three domains\" seems ambitious without clear feasibility justification\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources\n\n**Insufficient Evidence:**\n- While marked as sufficient (scores of 2), the review acknowledges \"delineation of FTE, timelines, and defined roles for junior staff is limited\"\n- No evidence provided about investigators' prior experience with Delphi methodology\n- Missing details about data management infrastructure for multi-site coordination\n\n### Additional Review Criteria\n\n**Critical Omissions:**\n- Human Subjects section states protections are \"alluded to\" but \"details... are not provided\" - this is a major deficiency\n- No assessment of data sharing plans for policy recommendations\n- Authentication of Key Resources section completely absent\n- Budget assessment avoided despite its critical role in feasibility determination\n\n### Overall Impact\n\n**Score Inconsistency:**\n- Overall Impact score of 4 is inconsistent with component scores (3, 2, 5, 4, 2)\n- Mathematical average of component scores = 3.2, suggesting overall should be 3 or lower\n- The \"speculative\" real-world impact and missing implementation strategy should substantially lower the overall score\n\n**Logical Flaws:**\n1. Claims \"highly qualified investigative team\" while noting limited role delineation\n2. States \"Methodological rigor is fair to strong\" after listing multiple fundamental gaps\n3. Describes impact as \"credible\" while acknowledging it's \"speculative\"\n\n### Summary\n\n**Strengths of the Review:**\n- Appropriate identification of methodological weaknesses\n- Recognition of missing human subjects details\n- Clear recommendations for improvement\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n1. **Systematic score inflation** - nearly all scores are 1-2 points higher than weaknesses justify\n2. **Insufficient evidence grounding** - continues to make broad claims without specific proposal citations\n3. **Internal contradictions** - strengths and weaknesses descriptions don't align with assigned scores\n4. **Missing NIH requirements** - several mandatory review sections inadequately addressed\n\n**Recommended Revisions:**\n1. Recalibrate all scores downward to align with identified weaknesses\n2. Provide specific page/section citations for every claim\n3. Complete all required NIH review sections\n4. Resolve contradictions between narrative assessments and numeric scores\n5. Apply consistent scoring logic across all factors\n\nThe review shows improvement in identifying weaknesses but fails to translate these insights into appropriate scoring, maintaining an overly optimistic assessment inconsistent with NIH review standards.",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nThank you to NIH_claude_opus4 for a thorough, evidence-based critique. I accept that my previous review suffered from systematic score inflation and insufficient granularity in evidentiary citations, as well as several logical inconsistencies between narrative and numeric evaluations. Below, I directly address each of these issues, explaining where I agree or disagree, and then provide a fully revised NIH-style review incorporating all mandatory sections, rigorously aligned scoring, and explicit, proposal-grounded evidence.\n\n---\n\n**POINT-BY-POINT RESPONSE TO CRITIQUE**\n\n**Score-Justification Alignment:**  \nI agree my previous scores were overly generous in the face of salient weaknesses, particularly around methodological rigor, innovation, and human subjects protection. These have now been recalibrated to align with the seriousness of the gaps identified.\n\n**Citations and Specific Evidence:**  \nAgreed. My prior reviews leaned on summary and paraphrase; in this revision, I use direct citations by section and, where possible, page, from your supplied text (“Specific Aims,” “Research Strategy,” “Approach,” etc.).\n\n**NIH Section Completeness:**  \nI concur with the need to systematically and thoroughly address each required NIH review criterion, including data sharing/authentication and human subjects.\n\n**Internal Consistency and Scoring Logic:**  \nAgreed; scores and narrative must not contradict one another. In the revision below, I ensure that every score is reflective of the balance of strengths and weaknesses identified, and that section justifications logically match numeric values.\n\n**Mandated Page/Section Anchoring:**  \nAccepted and implemented—claims are tied to the location in the document where feasible.\n\n---\n\n# REVISED NIH PEER REVIEW  \n*(All scores: 1 = Exceptional, 9 = Poor)*\n\n## Title:  \nPolicy Priorities and Stakeholder Consultation for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Adoption\n\n## Mechanism:  \nRegular NIH Research Project Grant (R01) – inferred from “Regular Research Program” (Research Strategy, p.2)\n\n---\n\n### 1. Overall Impact\n\n**SCORE: 5**  \n*“The likelihood that the proposal will exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, based on the review criteria below.”*\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Addresses a critical and timely need: “The proposed study will respond directly to the program announcement PA-11-250 to begin to prioritize and address the unique policy challenges raised by WGS…” (Specific Aims, p.1).\n- Engages a broad spectrum of stakeholder domains via a structured, modified Delphi process encompassing “oversight of test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and coverage and reimbursement of WGS.” (Specific Aims, p.1).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- Lacks post-project adoption/evaluation strategy—policy uptake described only via “dissemination” (Specific Aims, p.2; Approach, p.2), not measured change.\n- Relies on speculative real-world impact, e.g., “This work will help ensure policymakers have access to existing evidence and policy options…” without a plan for implementation beyond briefings or white papers (Research Strategy, p.5).\n- Did not supply a project title, grant number, or full mechanism in submitted material.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nExplicitly define an evaluation or follow-up phase to measure the impact of disseminated policy recommendations and document agency/industry uptake, not just product delivery.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Significance\n\n**SCORE: 5**\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The need for new policy approaches is amply documented: “The current regulatory framework … was not designed to integrate WGS into clinical practice. Thus, new policy approaches may be required…” (Specific Aims, p.1).\n- Aligns with national priorities (“NHGRI program announcement ‘ELSI of Genomic Research Regular Research Program’ PA-11-250,” Research Strategy, p.2).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- Proposal does not concretely distinguish its work from existing or parallel efforts, e.g., NIH/FDA ELSI initiatives, Genetic Testing Registry, FDA public meetings (Research Strategy, p.3).\n- Health system/public impact (e.g., improved access, cost or outcomes) is asserted, not documented by likely mechanisms or potential magnitude.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nDescribe the unique contribution of this project relative to ongoing or recent nationwide regulatory efforts; establish clear health-system or research outputs that could be evaluated post-completion.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Investigators\n\n**SCORE: 4**\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Names and backgrounds of PIs and core senior team are provided: “David Kaufman and Amy McGuire … genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics…” (Research Strategy, p.5); additional named experts for WGS quality, IP/patenting, and reimbursement.\n- An 8-member “expert advisory board” described, with major institutional affiliations and policy experience (Research Strategy, p.6).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- No delineation of FTE or specific time commitments among team members.\n- No description of prior experience with the Delphi process among PIs or key personnel, only general statements (Approach, p.7).\n- Lacks evidence for training or involvement of junior investigators.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nArticulate role allocation, prior experience with all methods (including Delphi), and plans for internal team development/mentoring.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Innovation\n\n**SCORE: 6**\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Breadth across multiple domains (quality, patent, coverage) and stakeholder diversity ahead of large-scale WGS adoption is positive (Research Strategy, p.4).\n- Integration of WGS industry landscape analysis and policy development through modified Delphi engages a wider real-world policy community (Approach, p.7–8).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- Delphi process itself is not novel and is widely used in consensus/policy-building.\n- No unique analytical or translational method described; “innovation” claim is primarily timing (i.e., intervening before WGS matures) rather than method or scope (Approach, p.7).\n- Lack of pilot data or demonstration of Delphi’s previous efficacy for regulatory change in genomics.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nReposition the project as making a timely, integrative contribution, but do not claim methodological innovation. Wherever possible, document past results from using Delphi in genomics policy or overlapping fields.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Approach\n\n**SCORE: 6**\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Systematic process for landscape analysis and company/industry interviews specified, e.g., “interviews with up to 20 industry leaders” (Research Strategy, p.7).\n- Delphi panel size (n = 40), domain composition, themes, surveys, code assignment for anonymity, Likert scaling for priorities, and iterative process (Approach, p.11–14).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- Sparse statistical justification for sample (Delphi n = 40), analytic framework, or measurement of consensus quality (Approach, p.13).\n- Human subjects protection section does not specify IRB status, consent, confidentiality, or data security plan; “protections for anonymity and confidentiality” only referenced in passing (Research Strategy, p.7).\n- No details on how nonresponse or persistent panel disagreements will be addressed, nor how policy alternatives or thematic findings will be synthesized or validated after Delphi.\n- No budget-justified rationale for staffing, resources, update/longevity of landscape analysis.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nProvide a detailed analytic plan, justification for sample sizes, data handling, and explicit human subjects protection details. Address disagreement handling, attrition, resource sufficiency, and any feasibility/budgetary risks.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Environment\n\n**SCORE: 4**\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Institutional affiliations across highly regarded centers (Baylor College of Medicine, Duke, CMTP, Burness Communications)—increases communication and dissemination reach (Research Strategy, p.6).\n- Letters of agreement for advisory board and buy-in from partners (“letters of support from WGS technology and informatics companies,” Approach, p.13).\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- No explicit statement of available facilities, core resources, data management infrastructure, or contingency planning (e.g., if industry engagement fails, Research Strategy and Approach).\n- No provided budget, no mention of dedicated space, data security, or IRB-reviewed data systems.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nDescribe the physical/IT infrastructure, space, communication platforms, and administrative/contingency support available to the project; attach or summarize budgetary rationale.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Review Criteria\n\n**Human Subjects:**  \n- Human subjects protections described in vague terms regarding “anonymity and confidentiality” (Research Strategy, p.7) but no mention of IRB approval, informed consent, or data security. Major concern due to the scale of engagement and sensitivity of organizational/private data.\n\n**Vertebrate Animals:**  \n- Not applicable.\n\n**Biohazards:**  \n- Not applicable.\n\n**Authentication of Key Resources:**  \n- Not addressed; for a policy project, this would include documentation of methodology transparency, reproducibility of survey/data instruments, and sharing of all analytic tools and templates as deliverables.\n\n**Budget & Period of Support:**  \n- Not included; real resource needs and timeline feasibility cannot be independently verified.\n\n---\n\n## Summary and Overall Recommendations\n\n**This proposal targets a significant, timely need in genomics policy and offers strong investigator expertise, widespread institutional support, and robust stakeholder engagement. However, the approach and innovation sections are undermined by the lack of methodological rigor—most notably, the insufficient detail on analytic/statistical strategy, ethical/IRB material, and feasibility justifications. The impact and significance, while credible in early policy prioritization, may fall short without a supporting implementation and evaluation plan.**\n\n**To strengthen the application:**  \n- Explicitly delineate human subjects protections, analytic framework, sample size/panel selection rationale, and how panel data will be synthesized and judged.\n- Provide comparative context with similar NIH/FDA initiatives, and clarify unique project contributions.\n- Detail facilities, infrastructure, and contingency planning.\n- Recalibrate innovation claims and focus on substantiated, pragmatic contributions.\n\n**OVERALL IMPACT: 5**  \n*Accurately reflects the proposal's genuine strengths in significance and team, but recognizes fundamental, unresolved limitations in rigor, innovation, and feasibility as currently presented.*\n\n---\n\nIf you wish, I am prepared to further elaborate on any section, review specific pages, or address additional NIH review requirements.",
