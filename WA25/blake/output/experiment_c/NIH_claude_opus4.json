The extent to which genomics will improve health outcomes on a \npopulation level, however,\ndepends in part on effective oversight. The volume of information generated by \nWGS and the uncertainty about\nthe utility of the data, the indications for which it should be used, who will \npay for it, and the extent to which\npatents and licensing affect access are all issues that command the attention of  \nthe policy community. The\ncurrent regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing and \nnewborn screening was not\ndesigned to integrate WGS into clinical practice. Thus, new policy approaches \nmay be required ta establish a\nsystem that guarantees appropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data \nand valid reports while\nencouraging innovation. The proposed study will respond directly to the program \nannouncement PA-11-250 to\nbegin to prioritize and address the unique policy challenges raised by WGS using  \na systematic consultation\nthat could be applied to future regulatory work in this area.\nWe have organized a group with expertise in three of the domains where WGS poses  \nunique challenges:\noversight of test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and the \ncoverage and reimbursement of\nWS. In consultation with an expert stakeholder panel, we will systematically \ndelineate and prioritize an\nauthcritative list of specific, tractable questions that policymakers should \nconsider as WGS comes to the clinic.\nWe will select three high-priority questions within our three domains, and work \nwith the panel to develop policy\napproaches to address them. This work will be informed by an initial landscape \nanalysis of the current and\nnear-future status of he WGS industry, as described by several of its leaders. \nBuilding on our team's expertise\nand extensive experience in both genetic testing policy and stakeholder \nengagement methods, we propose the\nfollowing aims to answer the call for regulatory science needed to inform \ndecision making in the face of rapid\ndevelopments in genomic healthcare.\nAim 1. Describe the current whole genome sequencing industry to establish a \nbasis for identifying\nand addressing related policy issues. To provide a clear understanding of WGS, \nwe will conduct the first\nU.S-centered landscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing on the \ngeneration, delivery, and\ninterpretation of genomic data. A review of literature, websites and company \nmaterials will be enhanced by\ninterviewing industry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS.\nAim 2. Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole genome \nsequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nto iteratively engage key siakeholders. Using our landscape analysis, our \ninterview data, and our\nknowledge of current standards and peclicy, we will develop a preliminary list \nof policy questions unique to\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nthe clinical use of WGS. A panel of 40 key stakeholders will then be iteratively  \nsurveyed to add to and refine\nthis list and to rank the resulting questions in terms of importance and \ntractability. An authoritative list of clear\npolicy priorities related to the clinical use WGS will result.\nWe will then develop policy approaches to address three high-priority issues, \none from each area of our team's\nexpertise: test quality and validity, healthcare reimbursement, and intellectual  \nproperty. We will systematically\nanalyze the extent to which current laws, professional guidelines, and industry \nstandards contribute to or\naddress the selected questions. Using this analysis as a starting point, we will  \nagain iteratively survey\nstakeholders to solicit and refine a variety of policy approaches to the \nquestions. The resulting set of\napproaches will be discussed by the stakeholder panel at a summit meeting to \nidentify areas of agreement and\nreasons for disagreement. A report summarizing how our methods and findings \nmight be applied to the\nbroader range of WGS policy issues will be developed and disseminated.\nAim 3. Disseminate findings to policymakers and key stakeholders. Beginning with  \nthe landscape\nanalysis, we will distribute our findings in concise, accessible formats (e.g., \nwhite papers, briefs, webcasts) to a\nbroad range of stakeholders to inform policy development. Two public briefings \nfor Washington-based\npolicymakers will be held to disseminate findings fram the Delphi process. \nFollow-up meetings with select\nfederal officials, Gongressional members and staff will be used to begin focused  \ndialogues on clinical WGS.\nSpecific Aims Page 101\n============================================================\nPage 2\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nRESEARCH STRATEGY\nA. SIGNIFICANCE\nThis application responds directly to one of the primary goals of the NHGRI \nprogram announcement \"Ethical,\nLegal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Genomic Research Regular Research \nProgram\" (PA-11-250},' which\nreads \"New legal and regulatory approaches need to be crafted in anticipation of  \nor in response to rapid\ndevelopments in genomic research and genomic health care....Research will be \nneeded to explore the effects\nof existing policies and regulations and to provide data to inform the \ndevelopment of new policies and\nregulatory approaches.â \nRapid innovation in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has brought us \nwhole genome sequencing\n(WWGS) that can be generated quickly and cheaply enough to be used for clinical \npurposes. In 1996, President\nClinton tantalized the public when he said: â I think it won't be too many \nyears before parents will be able to\ngo home from the hospital with their newborn babies with a genetic map in their \nhands that will tell them,\nhere's what your child's future will likely be like.â  Jay Flatley, CEO of \nIllumina, predicted that WGS would be\nâ technically feasible and affordableâ  by 2014 and â routineâ  by 2019.    \nExactly five years ago, in October 2008,\nthe cost of sequencing an entire human genome was $10.4 million; today it is \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n1,000 times less expensive.Â° The\nNHGRI has recently committed an additional $18 million to spur development of \nfaster technologies.* Some\nresearchers predict that five years from now it will be possible to sequence an \nentire human genome in a\nmatter of hours for $100 or less.*Â°\nDemonstrating the clinica] potential of these new technologies, whole exome \nsequencing (WES) and WGS\nhave already been used successfully to diagnose and treat disease,â  Â° and \ninsurance companies have agreed\nto cover the cost of WGS in at least two cases.\"' A growing number of diagnostic  \nlaboratories are adding next-\ngeneration sequencing to their menu of services.'* Some experts think genomic \nsequencing is ready for\nroutine clinical use.'*\"*\nAlthough the technology had advanced to the point where it can be used address \nspecific clinical questions an\nemerging consensus that the U.S. health care system does not have an established  \nsystem of procedures,\nknowledge and resources to effectively interpret and deliver WGS information to \npatients and providers.\nThe extent to which genomic medicine improves health outcames on a population \nlevel will depend on the\neffective oversight of clinical WGS. The current regulatory framework that \nguides single-gene diagnostic\ntesting and newborn screening were not designed with the complexity of whole \ngenome sequencing in mind,\nand will not suffice without new approaches or creative applications of existing  \npolicy.\nEric Green and Mark Guyer recently wrote that \"the amount and heterogeneous \nnature of the data, which will\ninclude both expected and unexpected results, will antiquate current mechanisms \nfor delivering medical\ninformation to patientsâ .'Â° The mechanisms currently in place are themselves \nthe result of extensive research\nio craft a system of regulatory policies that guide the practice of genetic \ntesting.'Â® The nature and character\nof the data referred to by Drs. Green and Guyer would seem to necessitate a call  \nfor forward-thinking policy\nresearch and guidance. New policy approaches will be needed to establish a \nsystem that promotes\nappropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data and valid reports while \nencouraging innovation.\nWGS's rapid transition to clinical use has prompted a wide range of initiatives,  \nincluding NIHâ s National Genter \nfor Advancing Translational Sciences,\"* and NHGRIâ s most recent ELSI program \nannouncement, '? and\nheightened the importance of efforts like the FDA and NIH's collaborative \nregulatory science initiative*Â° and the\nGenetic Testing Registry. In June 2011, the FDA held a public meeting to discuss  \napproaches to establish the\nsafety and effectiveness of clinical genomic sequencing. Likewise, insurers and \npharmacy benefits managers\nare creating positions for the management of genomics services.\nThere are numerous policy needs that require the attention of stakeholder groups  \nwith diverse, strong\ninterests in the governance of WGS. Among the many challenges we face are: \nensuring the quality and utility\nof WGS data and interpretation; defining the indications for which WGS should be  \nused; determining whe will\npay for it; developing systems of patents and licensing that maximize access \nwhile rewarding innovation; the\nResearch Strategy Page 102\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n============================================================\nPage 3\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nstorage and integration of data into medical records; issues of ownership and \nprivacy; personnel and training\nneeds; and whether the technology is best used for diagnostic purposes or health  \nscreening.\nWe have organized a research team with expertise in three of these domains: the \noversight of test quality and\nservices; patenting and licensing issues; and the coverage and reimbursement of \nmolecular diagnostics. WGS\nis likely to raise several important questions in each of these areas. How \nshould a WGS test, which could\nsimultaneously produce a result with clear utility, a result with unintended \nconsequences, and a result whose\ninterpretation will change with future research, be categorized under the FDA's \nproposed risk-based approach\nio regulation?â Â° How will insurers address the complexity of the information \ncreated by WGS technology? Will\nthe lack of clinical utility data limit or prevent coverage? Will clinical \nlaboratories be able to offer a camplete\ngenome sequence when some of the genomic landscape is restricted by intellectual  \nproperty patents?*' Are\nlicensing restrictions likely to reduce the utility of the available sequence?\nWith little empiric data available to answer such questions, there is a large \ndegree of uncertainty about the\nnature and relative importance of these policy domains. However there is an \nimmediate need for critical\nthought about what the policy priorities are and how we may begin to address \nthem.\nIn the absence of data about the validity, accuracy or utility of WGS, or how \nstrong the enforcement of patent\nclaims against WGS laboratories will we will develop a set of policy priorities \nfor clinical WGS by consulting a\ndiverse group of stakeholders, including WGS technology and informatics \ncompanies, clinical laboratories,\nhealth care professionals, insurers, regulatory and public health agencies, \nhealth economists, and patient\ngroups. The findings of this study will be driven primarily by the experiences \nand opinions of experts who are\ncurrently developing, monitoring and regulating the tools and technology for the  \nclinical use of WGS\nA modified Delphi process will be to elicit expert stakeholdersâ  input on all \nrelevant policy issues and their\nrelative importance and tractability. This highly structured approach to \nstakeholder engagement allows a\ngeographically and professionally diverse group of experts to anonymously \nprovide one another with\nquantitative and qualitative feedback about the ideas of others on the panel. \nAnalysis of this feedback can lead\nto a prioritized list of WGS issues as defined by the entire community of \nstakeholders, or a detailed critique of\npolicy options to address a given policy problem. Points of agreement between \nstakeholders and reasons for\ndisagreement can be identified. To ensure that this work is based on an \nunderstanding of the actual\ncapabilities and business models of WGS companies, we will begin by conducting \nthe first U.S-centered\nlandscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing an the generation, \ndelivery, and interpretation of\ngenomic data. Throughout the course of the study we will distribute our findings  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nin concise formats that are\naccessible to policymakers.\nConducting policy planning now, as this rapidly-advancing technology begins to \nmature, presents an\nopporiunity to evaluate and influence both the industry and policy options. This  \nwork will help to ensure that\npolicymakers have sound access to existing evidence and policy options based on \nwide-ranging expert\nopinions and rigorous research. A significant portion of the impact of this \nproject will come from active efforts to\ndisseminate our findings to policymakers in order to stimulate discussion and \ninform efforts to enact\nappropriate regulatory reform.\nB. Innovation\n[[This proposal is innovative in four ways. First, it will be one of the first \ncomprehensive projects to\nsystematically assess U.S. policy needs since whole genome sequencing (WGS) has \nbecome available for\nclinical use.'*'Â° Conducting policy work now, just as WGS is becoming \nclinically available and before this\nrapidly-advancing technology matures, will allow us to consider policy questions  \nas they arise in real time, and\noffers the prospect of influencing the early practices and expectations of those  \ninvolved with clinical WGS. Ta\ndate, policy work related to the clinical use of WGS has been largely \ntheoretical. Our propased policy analysis\nis innovative in that it is based on direct engagement with WGS campanies and \nother key stakeholders. This\nwill ensure a forward-looking description of the WGS industry, and the \nproduction of policy priorities and\napproaches that are grounded in a broad range of highly relevant experiences. ]]\nResearch Strategy Page 103\n============================================================\nPage 4\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nSecond, most policy work to date has focused on issues primarily related to \nsingle gene testing and is typically\nlimited to a single policy domain. This proposal explores and prioritizes the \nmast pressing policy questions\nacross three major areas: quality assurance, reimbursement, and patents and \nlicensing. The breadth and\ndepth of the project staff's expertise facilitates the simultaneous development \nof policy approaches in these\ndomains. By disseminating the policy priorities, we hope to stimulate the \ndevelopment of policy approaches\namong experts in other areas such as equitable access to services, privacy, and \ndata access and storage.\n[[Third, we propose using an innovative modified Delphi approach to ensure the \nsystematic incorporation of a\nwide range of highly relevant perspectives in our priority setting and policy \ndevelopment. Members of the\nstakeholder panel anonymously review and propose revisions to other panel \nmembers' ideas as the study\nprogresses. The results are conclusions that have been vetted from many \ndifferent perspectives at a high level.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of each policy approach, as viewed by the range of \nstakeholders will be of\ntremendous value as policymakers and stakeholders begin earnest discussions to \nguide the implementation of\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nW6GS. lf the Delphi process is successful and productive, it could result in the  \nestablishment of a framework,\nor methodological pipeline, to evaluate additional WGS policy issues moving \nforward.]]\nFinally, the direct dissemination of findings to the policy community will \nincrease the uptake and use of this\nwork. Washington-based policy briefings, issue briefs, and online media tools \nwill be used to distribute our\nlandscape analysis, policy priorities, policy approaches, and an account of the \nDelphi process. The expertise of\nBurness Communications will help to ensure the success of our outreach efforts.\nC. Approach\nWe plan to combine straightforward methods of landscape and policy analysis with  \na modified Delphi process,\nin which a diverse panel of key stakeholders are iteratively surveyed for their \nopinions and feedback, to\nsystematically identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\nto develop policy approaches to address the most pressing, tractable issues, as \njudged by our\nstakeholder panel. As with all policy analysis, the first step is to identify \nand clearly define the process being\ngoverned and the nature of the issues that need to be addressed. We will begin \nin Aim 1 by conducting the\nfirst systematic, landscape analysis of the current WGS industry to clearly \ndefine the business methods and\nservices involved in that are being employed to commercialize clinical WGS. To \ninform the development of\nforward-thinking policy, and gain first-hand knowledge of emerging business \nmodels, we will interview\nindustry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS. This innovative, \ncomprehensive landscape\nanalysis will provide a framework for identifying and prioritizing novel policy \nquestions, outlining policy-\nrelevant aspects of the WGS industry including self-imposed quality standards, \ncapabilities and services\nbeing offered, targeted indications and markets, patents held and health claims \nbeing made. This\nassessment of the industry's approaches to clinical sequencing will directly \ninform the development and\nprioritization of major policy issues related to WGS in Aim 2.\n[[In Aim 2 we will engage a diverse panel of experts to define and prioritize \nmajor policy issues related to\nWGS. A preliminary list of policy questions will be generated from the landscape  \nanalysis and our\nknowledge of current standards and policy. We will use a modified Delphi process  \nto systematically collect\nand integrate the opinions of ~40 key stakeholders. A modified Delphi process \nadds an in-person meeting\nof stakeholders and project staff to the traditional process of iterative \nstakeholder surveys.â  The \nstakeholder panel will be drawn from the WGS industry, including WGS technolagy \ncompanies, infarmatics\ncompanies, trade associations, and clinical laboratories; the health care \nsystem, including public and private\ninsurers, pharmacy benefits managers, healthcare systems, provider groups, \nprofessional associations,\nclinical geneticists, and genetic counselors; and policymakers, academics and \nthe public, including\nregulatory and public health agencies (FDA, FTC, CMS, HHS, PTO, CDC, Congress), \nhealth economists,\npatient groups, and intellectual property expert.***? Stakehalders will be \niteratively surveyed (see Figure 1).\nThe results of each survey will be summarized and analyzed by project staff, and  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nreturned ta the panel\nmembers for criticism and comment in the following round. A final in-person \nmeeting will be used to gather\nmore detailed opinions about policy approaches to three high priority questions \nThis process will result in\nthree products: (1) a prioritized list of policy questions for consideration by \nthe policy community, (2) policy\napproaches developed to address three of the most pressing issues as defined by \nthe panel, and {3} a\nsummary of the Delphi process as a technique for developing these approaches. \nThe policy priorities and\nResearch Strategy Page 104\n============================================================\nPage 5\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nthe resulting set of draft approaches will be disseminated in a timely and \naccessible fashion to federal and\nsiate regulators, genome technology developers, investors, health care \nproviders, and other stakeholder\ngroups in Aim 3.]] A preliminary list of stakeholders is found in the Appendix.\nThis project will leverage the expertise, insight, and working relationships \nestablished by an accomplished\nstudy team and a diverse panel of stakeholders to efficiently and \ncomprehensively collect and analyze\ninformation relevant to WGS policy decisions. In this section we describe: (1) \nthe research team and expert\nadvisory board; (2) the research plan and timeline; (3) potential limitations of  \nthe study; and (4} a brief\nsummary of relevant preliminary work.\nC.1 Research team and advisory board\nThe research team will be led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, who combine \nsignificant expertise\nin genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics with extensive experience \nengaging stakeholders and developing\nand disseminating policy options.*** Analysis of the oversight of WGS quality \nwill be led by Gail Javitt, one of\nthe nationâ s foremost experts on FDA law and CMS/CLIA regulation of genetic \ntesting quality and utility. Ms.\nJavitt led the Genetic Testing Quality Initiative at the Genetics and Public \nPolicy Center, which identified gaps\nin federal oversight of single-gene genetic test quality and delivered \nrecommendations to policymakers using a\nwide variety of formats. More recently she published recommendations for a \nblueprint of a genetic test\nregistryÂ®â  and led the GPPC effort to evaluate the policy implications of DTC   \ngenetic testing.â  This proposal \nbuilds on Ms. Javitt's prior work by applying her detailed knowledge of the \nregulatory bodies that have\njurisdiction over genetic testing to quality assurance issues raised by next-\ngeneration sequencing methods with\ndifferent standards, data output, reports and error rates.\nIssues of intellectual property, technology transfer, and relevant aspects of \npolicy engagement will be\naddressed by Robert Gook-Deegan, who is the director of the Duke University \nCenter for Genome Ethics, Law\n& Policy, and a leading expert on the effects of patents and licensing practices  \non genetic testing. Since 2009,\nDr. Gook-Deegan has published an extensive number of peer-reviewed articles \nrelated to human gene\n\n--- Page 8 ---\npatenting. Among his many contributions to the field are patent case studies \nthat served as the basis for the\n2010 SAGGHS Report on Gene Patents and Licensing Practices and Their Impact on \nPatient Access to\nGenetic Tests. The study will extend his work to consider policy approaches to \npatent and licensing issues\npresented by clinical applications of WGS.\nSean Tunis, Pat Deverka, and Donna Messner of the Center for Medical Technology \nPolicy (CMTP}) in\nBaltimore, MD, will address issues of insurance coverage and reimbursement \npolicies for WGS. As founder\nand Director of GMTP, Dr. Tunis is a recognized leader in the assessment of \nmedical technologies, including\nmolecular diagnostics, and the development of guidance for insurance coverage of  \nthese tools. As the Chief\nMedical Officer at CMS, he supervised the development of national coverage \npolicies and quality standards for\nthe adoption of new technologies by Medicare and Medicaid providers. He is \njoined by Dr. Deverka, an expert\nin the identification of policy approaches to improve the clinical translation \nof personalized medicine.

We \nwill refine and narrow\nResearch Strategy Page 106\n============================================================\nPage 7\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nour definition of WGS companies, eliminating any that are not offering relevant \nproducts or services. The\nlandscape report will include sections identifying the companies, the service \nmodels for clinical WGS, the\nmarkets being addressed, and who is paying for the services.\n[Interviews with industry leaders: WGS business models and technologies are \nchanging rapidly. To anticipate\nthese developments as we draft policy approaches, project staff at GPPC will \nconduct semi-structured\ninterviews with a purposive sample of up to 20 industry leaders to seek their \nperspectives on the future of\nclinical WGS. Interviews will not ask leaders about specific business plans, as \nthis information is unlikely to be\ndivulged. We will recruit chief executives and senior scientific and business \nofficers from companies identified\nin the landscape analysis. Recruitment will cease when saturation of interview \nfindings occurs or 20 interviews\nare completed. Based on GPPC and CMTP's experience recruiting scientists and \nprofessional stakeholders for\nother interview studies, we believe we will be able to enroll 20 individuals \nfrom what we expect will be at least\n40 companies with at least three eligible staff each.\nAn interview guide will be drafted, piloted among advisory board members, and \nrevised. The guide will contain\na small number of general questions designed to evoke a conversational tone and \nelicit opinions about the\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nfuture directions of clinical WGS. Questions might include how participants \nthink WGS is most likely to be\nintegrated into care, or what companies need to do to prepare for the many \npossible clinical uses of WGS. We\nwill also use this opportunity to collect information about industry standards \nand self-regulatian. Telephone\ninterviews lasting 30-40 minutes will be audio taped using two recording devices  \nto prevent data loss. All\ninterview materials will be de-identified and kept confidential; no data will be  \nreported on the individual level.\nTapes will be transcribed. After all personal identifiers are deleted, \ntranscripts will be entered into the\nqualitative data analysis software NVivo version 9.0. We will apply an \nabbreviated content/thematic analysis to\nassimilate the interview data: a fairly simple coding scheme will be applied to \ncode transcripts for major themes\nrelated to the future of clinical WGS {e.g., \"emerging business modelsâ  or \nâ pathways to clinical integration\").\nThe entire research team will meet to review the coded transcripts, discuss the \nthemes that emerged, and\nintegrate the findings into the landscape analysis.\nEffective evaluation of the policy and oversight implications of WGS will \nrequire careful, ongoing monitoring of\nthe industry throughout the study to identify new entrants into the marketplace.  \nThroughout the course of the\nstudy we will search for emerging companies and business models, and we will \ndocument changes in existing\nWGS companies by regularly collecting screen shots of Web sites showing test \nofferings and changes in\nservices.]]\nffC.3 Aim 2: Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nthat iteratively engages key stakeholders. [[Note to reviewers: this Aim is new \nand replaces a more\ntraditional policy analysis.j}\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty about how whole genome sequencing will be \nincorporated into clinical\nmedicine, both generally and in the United Statesâ  healthcare complex. There \nis a general consensus that\nwhole genome sequencing will disrupt the patchwork of systems that currently \nguide clinical single-gene\ntesting and newborn screening, including existing codes and policies for \nreimbursement and insurance\ncoverage, appropriate indications for testing, standards to ensure genetic test \nquality, and intellectual\nproperty rights. However, the relative magnitude and importance of these \ndisruptions and the roles that\ndifferent governing bodies might play to effectively address these issues are \nnot well-understood. Scant\nempirical data exists to measure the performance of clinical WGS. Nevertheless, \nthe issues appear to be\napproaching rapidly and may overwhelm policy makers in a manner that is similar \nta, but perhaps more\nprofound than, the emergence of direct-to-consumer genetic testing.\nResearch Strategy Page 107\n============================================================\nPage 8\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nHenge ay uomyuiwie Foyronn menaw! yeueu Hau nanuiu ss reiuaieen ereerns\nIn order to efficiently prioritize\nand address policy needs in an Modified Delphi process to identify and \nprioritize policy questions related to WGS\narea with little empirical data and\na high level of uncertainty, we a _ Survey 1\nDelphi process, which\na broad range of experts and Study staff will use ranks to develop a list of \nspecific policy priorities.\nstakeholders.

The buy-in of these \norganizations, aur interviews with\nindustry leaders in Aim 1, our dissemination of the landscape analysis to \npolicymakers (Aim 3),and the\npresence of industry and thought leaders on the advisory panel will all serve as  \ncatalysts for additional\nrecruitment. ]]\nPreparation of the Delphi Panel and Delphi Materials: Maintaining panel \nmembersâ  anonymity in their \nSurvey responses encourages unconventional or unexpected ideas and questions.*Â°  \nHence, each panel\nmember will be assigned a two letter code that panel members and study staff \nwill use to refer to each\nother during the surveys.â * However, complete anonymity can undermine the \nprocess; participants need\nconfidence that their fellow participants are respected peers. A brief group \nbuilding exercise will be\nconducted at the outset to develop this confidence. Panel members will be asked \nto submit their names,\n\n--- Page 14 ---\naffiliations, and areas of expertise, as well as their concerns and hopes for \nthe Delphi process. A summary\nof this information will be disseminated to all participants. Panel members will  \nalso be sent the landscape\nanalysis from Aim 1, which will provide important context for the identification  \nand consideration of policy\nquestions. The initial surveys for both problem identification and the \ndevelopment of policy approaches will\nbe carefully developed ahead of time by staff and piloted with advisory board \nmembers. Instruments for the\nlater rounds will be determined by the panel responses.\nIdentification and prioritization of novel policy questions posed by WGS: The \nstakeholder panel and project\nStaff will engage in two rounds of input to clearly identify and prioritize \nunique policy questions related to the\nclinical use of WGS. Prior to the first round of the Delphi process, the entire \nstudy team, in consultation with\nthe advisory board, will use our landscape analysis and our knowledge of current  \nstandards and policy to\ndevelop a preliminary list of novel policy questions we believe are raised by \nclinical WGS. This â straw \nmodelâ  of policy questions will be submitted to panel members for \nconsideration as the first survey.\nParticipants will be asked to review the issues, add issues, comment on any \nissues they wish, and rate the\nimportance, validity, and technical and political feasibility of addressing each  \nissue using 5-point Likert\nscales.â \"' The use of these scales does not exclude other forms of \nclassification of the policy questions;\nwe will consider the findings of our landscape analysis and recommendations of \nthe advisory panel to\nidentify other measures by which these questions might be categorized.\nThe team will assess and summarize the responses. The resulting annotated list \nof policy questions will be\npresented back to the panel, who will use a second online survey to review the \nissues, make additional\ncomments, and again rate the importance, validity, and technical and political \nfeasibility of addressing each\nissue. The feedback will be summarized to produce an annotated list of policy \nquestions. The questions will\nbe prioritized using the ranked scale data. Numerical values for importance and \nvalidity will be summed to\nform a \"Priority\" scale ranging from 0 to 8, while values for technical \nfeasibility will be summed to form a\n\"Tractabilityâ  scale ranging from 0 to 8. An Overall scale summing all four \nitems (range 0-16) will also be\ntallied. Median values for the individual and combined scales will be calculated  \nfor each policy question.\nNumerical priority rankings will be computed after sorting the list of questions  \nby median Overall rating, then\nPriority. A second list of ratings will be computed, sorting by Overall rating \nfollowed by Tractability. An\nannotated, ranked, sortable list of priorities with median values of each \ncomposite and individual scale will\nbe published and disseminated in a variety of formats to the broader stakeholder  \ncommunities to inform the\ndevelopment of WGS-related policy.\nResearch Strategy Page 109\n============================================================\nPage 10\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nDevelopment of multiple policy approaches to address the most pressing, \ntractable issues in our areas of\nexpertise: The goal of generating policy approaches is to provide policymakers \nand others with several\nalternatives to address policy needs for the effective integration of WGS. \nIdeally, alternative approaches vary in\nterms of timing, mechanism, distribution of burden, extent of federal and state \ngovernment involvement, and\nstakeholder support. The second round of the Delphi process will be used to \ndevelop approaches that might\nnot have emerged from a less structured stakeholder conversation that could be \nled or dominated by members\nwith particular viewpoints. The process will also provide a detailed \nunderstanding of where various factions\nconverge and diverge, and the nature of disagreements. These data help to \nidentify aspects of policy that will\nrequire negotiation and compromise.\nSelection of the policy questions to address: We have organized a team with \nexpertise in three policy areas\nidentified by the program announcement as important to the success of clinical \nWGS - analytic validity and\ntesting quality (GPPC), patenting and licensing (Duke}, and reimbursement and \npayment (CMTP}. We will\naddress the most important, tractable issue identified by the panel in each of \nthese three categories. We\nrecognize that the panel will identity several important issues that lie outside  \nof these domains, and we will\nencourage others with appropriate expertise to take up the development of \npolicies to address them. We\nwill consult the advisory board on our choice of issues.\nAnalysis of the current legal and requlatory framework surrounding the three \nselected issues: Each policy\ngroup (GPP, Duke, and GMPT) will prepare an initial evaluation of the current \nfederal and state laws and\nregulations, [[professional and association guidelines, and standards being \nadopted by the WGSj] industry that\napply to the issues being addressed. We will consider the intended purpose of \nthese rules, whether they are\nboth broad and precise enough to address the policy issues being considered. We \nalso will examine whether\nand by whom compliance with existing laws is enforced. Finally, we will \ndetermine whether there are conflicts\nor redundancies between different Jaws and guidelines that may need to be \nresolved. These analyses will be\nwritten up into white papers and disseminated to pane] members to provide them \nwith context for the\ndevelopment of policy approaches. Drs. McGuire and Kaufman will coordinate the \nefforts of the three teams\nfo ensure that they produce comparable evaluations that can be combined and \nexamined together.\nThroughout the study, regular project meetings involving all key staff will be \nconducted to ensure timely\nprogress, as well as comparable goals and products among the different teams.\nDevelopment a range of potential policy approaches: To begin developing policy \nalternatives, Delphi panel\nmembers will be asked to â brainstormâ  in response to the third survey  \nconsisting of open-ended questions\nabout how best to address the three policy issues. Panelists will be asked to \nconsider the landscape of the\nindustry and the current policy environment as well as more specific outcomes \nsuch as the impact on public\nhealth, cost implications for the government and stakeholders, and the impact on  \naccess to WGS and other\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nservices. Additional criteria for consideration may also be identified. The \nproject team will simultaneously\nouiline its own policy approaches using the policy analysis framework developed \nby Patton & Sawicki.*?\nCombining stakeholder input with the project teamâ s approaches, we will \nprepare a straw model of policy\nalternatives to address each issue. Following the policy Delphi approach of,â *  \nthe straw model will take the\nform of a series of resolutions and arguments supporting each resolution.

The staff will \"moderateâ  the discussion by feeding mean and \nmedian rankings, comments and\nsuggestions back to panel members for a final survey to collect rankings and \nfeedback. The staff will\ncambine and summarize comments in the case of identical arguments.\nBefore disseminating the policy approaches more broadly, we will review our \nfindings at an in-person\nmeeting of the Delphi panel members and project staff.

      "content": "Hello Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI'm NIH_claude_opus4, your AI assistant. I'll be reviewing your NIH R01 grant proposal using the two-agent review framework. Let me begin with Agent A's structured review.\n\n---\n\n**AGENT A — NIH PEER REVIEW**\n\n**Title:** Policy Challenges in Whole Genome Sequencing: A Systematic Stakeholder Consultation  \n**PI:** David Kaufman and Amy McGuire (Co-PIs)  \n**Mechanism:** R01\n\n**FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)**\n\nThe proposal addresses the critical gap between rapid technological advances in whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the inadequate policy framework to govern its clinical implementation. The investigators identify that current regulatory structures designed for single-gene testing are insufficient for WGS complexity. The project's three specific aims systematically approach this problem: (1) conducting a landscape analysis of the WGS industry, (2) using a modified Delphi process to prioritize policy questions and develop approaches, and (3) disseminating findings to policymakers. The proposal demonstrates innovation by being among the first comprehensive policy assessments as WGS transitions to clinical use, addressing multiple policy domains simultaneously (quality assurance, reimbursement, patents/licensing), and employing a modified Delphi methodology to ensure systematic stakeholder input.\n\n**Score: 2**  \n**Justification:** The research addresses a highly significant and timely problem as WGS costs have dropped 1000-fold in five years and clinical implementation is imminent. The multi-domain approach and stakeholder engagement methodology represent meaningful innovation in policy research. The direct connection to PA-11-250's call for new regulatory approaches strengthens significance.\n\n**FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)**\n\nThe experimental design employs well-established methods including systematic landscape analysis through web searches and semi-structured interviews with 20 industry leaders, followed by a modified Delphi process with 40 expert stakeholders across five survey rounds and an in-person summit. The timeline spans 36 months with clear milestones. Preliminary work demonstrates the team's capability in conducting similar analyses for direct-to-consumer genetic testing. However, the proposal's reliance on stakeholder availability and the ambitious scope of addressing three distinct policy domains simultaneously presents feasibility concerns. The lack of specific contingency plans for stakeholder recruitment challenges or timeline delays represents a weakness.\n\n**Score: 3**  \n**Justification:** The methodology is appropriate and builds on established approaches, with strong preliminary work supporting feasibility. The 40-member Delphi panel size is manageable and the modified approach adding an in-person meeting enhances validity. However, coordinating three parallel policy analyses across different institutions while maintaining stakeholder engagement over 20 months presents logistical challenges inadequately addressed.\n\n**FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources**\n\n**Mark: Sufficient**\n\nThe investigative team brings exceptional expertise: Kaufman and McGuire have extensive experience in genetic policy and stakeholder engagement; Javitt is a leading expert on FDA/CLIA regulation; Cook-Deegan brings deep knowledge of gene patents; Tunis, Deverka, and Messner from CMTP contribute reimbursement policy expertise. The eight-member advisory board includes pioneers like George Church and Jonathan Rothberg. Institutional support from Johns Hopkins (GPPC), Baylor, Duke, and CMTP provides robust infrastructure.\n\n**ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA**\n\n**Human Subjects:** Not Applicable - stakeholder interviews are exempt  \n**Vertebrate Animals:** Not Applicable  \n**Biohazards:** Not Applicable  \n**Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not Applicable\n\n**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS**\n\n**Authentication of Key Resources:** Not Applicable  \n**Budget and Period of Support:** 36-month timeline appears appropriate for scope\n\n**OVERALL IMPACT SCORE: 2**\n\n**Justification:** This proposal addresses a critical and timely policy gap as WGS rapidly transitions to clinical use, with costs dropping from $10.4 million to under $10,000 in five years. The systematic approach to identifying and prioritizing policy challenges through structured stakeholder engagement has high potential to influence regulatory frameworks before problematic precedents are established. The exceptional investigative team combining expertise in regulation, intellectual property, and reimbursement with strong preliminary work in genetic testing policy enhances likelihood of success.",

With the accelerated availability and use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in clinical settings, considerable uncertainty surrounds regulatory oversight, reimbursement, and intellectual property. The aims are responsive to urgent and unmet needs, namely establishing policy frameworks contemporaneous with the technology’s clinical integration rather than retrospectively. The methodology proposes both the identification and prioritization of policy gaps across quality assurance, reimbursement, and licensing—key domains with immediate relevance to improving equitable and safe access. The use of a modified Delphi process for expert stakeholder engagement is conceptually novel and provides a replicable framework. The significance is heightened by explicit alignment with NHGRI’s ELSI agenda and a timely focus as WGS adoption scales.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)  \n**Focus:** Scientific approach, design, reproducibility, inclusion, and feasibility\n\n**Score:** 3\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe approach integrates a systematic industry landscape analysis (web-based and qualitative), a meticulously described modified Delphi process for stakeholder priority-setting, and structured policy development, all of which are methodologically sound for the stated aims. The project is ambitious but feasible given the clear roadmap, access to relevant stakeholder groups, and recruitment strategies supported by letters of collaboration. The iterative survey design and in-person summit are well-conceived for capturing both quantitative rankings and rich qualitative data, promoting reproducibility in Delphi outputs. Some limitations are inherent given reliance on expert opinion in areas lacking empirical data; however, this is transparently acknowledged, and the process is well-justified within the context of policy research. Human subjects are not involved directly in clinical intervention; ethical and inclusion criteria focus on stakeholder and industry representativeness.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)  \n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe team has nationally recognized leaders in law, policy analysis, bioethics, and genomic science. Institutional resources at the Genetics and Public Policy Center, Duke, and CMTP, and a dedicated communications partner (Burness) strongly support execution and dissemination. The advisory board brings unparalleled depth in sequencing technology, regulation, economics, social science, and clinical genetics, mitigating risk of gaps in expertise or engagement failure.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA (Affect Impact but Not Scored)  \n- **Human Subjects:** Not applicable (stakeholder interviews and Delphi panel involve professionals, not patients).  \n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.  \n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.  \n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not explicitly stated.  \n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** N/A—relies on expert recruitment and policy analysis methods.  \n- **Budget and Period of Support:** Adequate for the stated 20-month, multi-phase process; no explicit flaws identified from provided content.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)  \n**Score:** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis proposal is highly likely to exert a sustained, transformative influence on clinical genomics policy during a period of rapid adoption of WGS. The research is timely, filling a critical gap where regulatory, legal, and reimbursement frameworks have not kept pace with technology. The combination of real-time landscape analysis, expert-driven consensus-building, and actionable policy development is both innovative and appropriately rigorous given available evidence. Minor feasibility risks arise from the complexity of recruiting and retaining a high-level expert panel, but the team’s extensive track record and early engagement strategies mitigate these. Overall, the project’s strengths in significance, design, and personnel more than offset these minor concerns, supporting a high overall impact.\n\n---\n\nIf you require additional sections broken out (e.g., more detail on human subjects plans or dissemination), or wish for discussion of specific review language, I am at your service.\n\nSincerely,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1, AI Assistant",

Modified Delphi processes are well-established in policy research and health services research.\n\n3. **Missing innovation discussion**: While the reviewer mentions alignment with NHGRI's ELSI agenda (significance), there is insufficient discussion of true methodological or conceptual innovation beyond standard policy research approaches.\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Insufficient critical analysis**: A score of 3 (excellent) appears overly generous given the acknowledged \"limitations...given reliance on expert opinion in areas lacking empirical data.\" This fundamental limitation should warrant more careful scoring.\n\n2. **Missing feasibility details**: The reviewer fails to critically assess the 20-month timeline for executing a complex multi-phase project including landscape analysis, Delphi rounds, and policy development.\n\n3. **Incomplete inclusion discussion**: While noting \"stakeholder and industry representativeness,\" the reviewer doesn't address potential biases in expert selection or geographic/institutional diversity.\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Unsupported claims**: Describing team members as \"nationally recognized leaders\" without specific evidence from the proposal text violates the instruction to avoid reputation-based assessments.\n\n2. **Missing critical evaluation**: The reviewer provides no analysis of potential gaps, such as whether the team includes sufficient regulatory expertise or patient advocacy representation.\n\n### Additional Review Criteria:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Dismissive treatment**: The reviewer incorrectly states human subjects are \"not applicable\" when stakeholder interviews clearly involve human participants requiring IRB review.\n\n2. **Missing budget analysis**: Despite instructions to summarize budget adequacy, the reviewer provides only superficial assessment (\"adequate\") without substantive evaluation.\n\n### Overall Impact:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Score inconsistency**: An overall impact score of 2 (high) seems inconsistent with identified limitations including reliance on expert opinion, complexity risks, and methodological constraints.\n\n2. **Unbalanced synthesis**: The justification heavily emphasizes strengths while minimizing acknowledged weaknesses, failing to provide the required \"balanced synthesis.\"\n\n3. **Hyperbolic language**: Terms like \"transformative influence\" and \"unparalleled depth\" violate NIH review conventions requiring measured, evidence-based language.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis review demonstrates several systematic weaknesses:\n- **Grade inflation**: Scores appear 1-2 points too favorable given described limitations\n- **Insufficient critical analysis**: The reviewer fails to probe methodological weaknesses\n- **Violation of review guidelines**: Multiple instances of reputation-based assessment and unsupported claims\n- **Structural gaps**: Missing required elements including proper human subjects consideration and budget evaluation\n\n**Recommended revisions:**\n1. Recalibrate scores to reflect acknowledged limitations (suggest Factor 1: 3-4, Factor 2: 4-5, Overall: 3-4)\n2. Remove reputation-based language and ground all claims in proposal text\n3. Provide substantive analysis of human subjects protections\n4. Address feasibility concerns more critically, especially timeline and stakeholder recruitment\n5. Balance the overall synthesis with equal weight to strengths and limitations\n\nThe review requires significant revision to meet NIH peer review standards for objectivity, evidence-based assessment, and balanced critical analysis.\n\nSincerely,\nNIH_claude_opus4, AI Assistant",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nThank you, Dr. Blake Dickerson, for sharing NIH_claude_opus4’s detailed critique. I acknowledge and accept the majority of these observations, as they reflect standard NIH review practice and a strict adherence to the required review framework. Please see my itemized reflection and a fully integrated, conventionally formatted review below.\n\n---\n\n### Reflection on Critique\n\n1. **Format**: I fully accept the critique that the division into “Strengths/Weaknesses/Recommendations” is non-compliant with the standard NIH format, which requires analytical prose that holistically synthesizes strengths and weaknesses.\n2. **Score Justification**: The critique is valid: scores must align with justification, which should cite aims, evidence from the application, and explicitly reference relevant gaps and weaknesses, even for strong proposals.\n3. **Specific Aims and Evidence**: I concur with the need to explicitly reference and cite specific aims, methods, and key proposal details in all factor justifications.\n4. **Rigor, Reproducibility, and Inclusion**: Omissions regarding rigor, reproducibility, inclusion criteria, and explicit reference to stakeholder panel protocols are well identified and must be corrected for compliance.\n5. **Expertise and Resources**: The critique points out missing detail about institutional support, resource sufficiency, and collaborations—these are core review elements and require greater elaboration.\n6. **Additional Criteria**: The prior oversimplification of human subjects concerns (the need for IRB, confidentiality, etc.) was incorrect. The proposal’s data management and resource authentication approach also requires explicit discussion.\n7. **Score Consistency**: The critique is correct that Impact scores must logically reflect scores and descriptive content for each factor; a holistic but coherent approach is mandatory.\n8. **Superlative Language**: Unsupported superlatives should be replaced with clear, evidence-based analysis.\n9. **Template Adherence and Tone**: The template and tone must be corrected to ensure NIH standards are fully met.\n\nThus, I will now present a fully integrated, analytically justified review in standard NIH prose, grounded directly in the content of the application.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Policy Priorities and Approaches for the Clinical Use of Whole Genome Sequencing]  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** R01 (inferred)\n\n---\n\n#### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)  \n**Score:** 3  \nThe proposed study directly responds to an unmet public health need by aiming to systematically address the unique policy challenges posed by the rapid clinical adoption of whole genome sequencing (WGS). The applicants articulate that existing regulatory frameworks for genetic testing are not equipped to navigate the volume, uncertainty, and diverse health system implications associated with WGS. Specific aims focus on (1) conducting a comprehensive U.S.-centered landscape analysis of the WGS industry, (2) identifying and prioritizing novel policy questions via stakeholder consultation using a modified Delphi process, and (3) developing authoritative policy approaches for key domains of test quality, reimbursement, and intellectual property. These aims are well-aligned with PA-11-250 and target high-impact gaps in regulatory science as WGS moves into clinical practice. The innovation lies in the timing—activating this systematic work just as WGS becomes a routine consideration for healthcare—and the structured, inclusive Delphi framework to build practical consensus. While the project’s potential significance is high, the application could be strengthened by further specifying mechanisms for translating prioritized policy questions into actionable guidance and greater engagement with potential barriers to real-world policy adoption.\n\n---\n\n#### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)  \n**Score:** 4  \nThe scientific approach is thoughtfully designed, integrating a web-based and interview-informed landscape analysis, followed by a structured, multi-stage Delphi process engaging a diverse 40-member stakeholder panel. The procedures for prioritizing policy questions and developing consensus recommendations are clearly described, including iterative surveys, anonymous feedback mechanisms, and a culminating in-person meeting. However, the success of the approach is contingent on maintaining engagement and sufficient cross-domain participation across 20 months. The proposal references prior experience with Delphi panels, but does not fully address strategies for minimizing attrition or ensuring reproducibility of qualitative and quantitative findings between Delphi rounds. While inclusion criteria for the expert panel are comprehensive—spanning industry, payers, regulators, clinicians, and patient groups—the process for ensuring representation and managing conflicts of interest could be further detailed. The application does not contain a thorough discussion of how human subjects protections (i.e., IRB approval, privacy, and consent for professional stakeholders) will be managed, which is required for this type of study involving interviews and repeated panel engagement.\n\n---\n\n#### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)  \n**Mark:** Sufficient  \nThe assembled investigative team includes recognized leaders in genetic policy, regulation, economics, and bioethics, as evidenced by their documented prior work, relevant publications, and active policy engagement. Institutions such as the Genetics and Public Policy Center, Duke University, and the Center for Medical Technology Policy are well-suited for the work, and the advisory board includes representatives from key stakeholder sectors. The collaboration model is clearly articulated, and the inclusion of a dedicated communications partner may enhance dissemination efforts. The application would benefit from greater specificity regarding institutional support, existing administrative resources, and data management infrastructure to assure reviewers of stable project execution, given the multi-institutional nature and complexity of the work.\n\n---\n\n#### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA  \n- **Human Subjects:** The proposal qualifies as human subjects research as it includes interviews and ongoing data collection from professionals and stakeholders. IRB review and participant protections (confidentiality, informed consent, secure data handling) must be explicitly addressed.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not discussed.\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** While the study is policy-focused, it should describe management, curation, and verification of interview data, policy documents, and other analytic products, as these may be resources for future work.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:** The multi-phase project’s success depends on adequate support for technical personnel, participant incentives, travel for in-person meetings, and communications/dissemination. The narrative would benefit from more specific commentary on budgetary appropriateness and contingency planning.\n\n---\n\n#### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)  \n**Score:** 4  \nThis application proposes a timely, innovative, and methodologically rigorous approach to develop and prioritize regulatory science and policy guidance for clinical WGS. The strengths include clear alignment with NHGRI goals, a strong interdisciplinary team, and an ambitious three-pronged set of aims targeting current system-wide gaps. Feasibility challenges, particularly in sustaining and managing stakeholder engagement through a complex multi-stage process, are notable and somewhat underdeveloped in the approach. Additionally, more attention is required for data management, reproducibility, and human subjects protocols. The overall impact is likely to be substantial if these risks are mitigated, positioning the project to inform policy and practice across multiple sectors.\n\n---\n\nSincerely,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1, AI Assistant",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_claude_opus4, AI assistant. I have carefully reviewed the response from NIH_gpt_4.1 and identified several critical flaws and areas requiring improvement in their NIH grant review.\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:\nThe score of 3 (Excellent) appears inconsistent with the justification provided. While the review identifies the project as addressing an \"unmet public health need\" and having \"high\" potential significance, it simultaneously notes substantial weaknesses including lack of \"mechanisms for translating prioritized policy questions into actionable guidance\" and insufficient \"engagement with potential barriers to real-world policy adoption.\" These are fundamental concerns about the project's ultimate impact that should result in a weaker score. The justification fails to adequately weigh these critical limitations against the strengths.\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:\nThe score of 4 (Very Good) is undermined by the numerous methodological concerns raised, including: contingency on maintaining stakeholder engagement, lack of strategies for minimizing attrition, insufficient detail on ensuring reproducibility, inadequate discussion of conflict of interest management, and missing human subjects protections. The review correctly identifies these issues but then assigns a score suggesting only minor concerns exist. Additionally, the review fails to assess statistical power, sample size justification, or quantitative analysis plans for the Delphi process outcomes.\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:\nWhile marked \"Sufficient,\" the justification acknowledges that \"greater specificity regarding institutional support, existing administrative resources, and data management infrastructure\" is needed. This contradiction suggests the mark should be \"Insufficient\" or the concerns should be removed from the justification. The review also fails to assess whether the team has specific expertise in Delphi methodology implementation.\n\n### Additional Criteria:\nThe human subjects section correctly identifies this as human subjects research but incorrectly states that IRB approval \"must be explicitly addressed\" as if it's missing. The review should clarify whether human subjects protections are actually absent from the proposal or merely underdeveloped. The authentication of key resources section is vague and doesn't address standard NIH concerns about research reagents, model organisms, or cell lines—though these may not be applicable to a policy study.\n\n### Overall Impact:\nThe overall impact score of 4 is mathematically inconsistent with factor scores of 3 and 4, which would typically yield an impact score closer to 3-3.5. More critically, the justification paragraph doesn't adequately synthesize how the identified weaknesses (feasibility challenges, data management issues, human subjects concerns) would limit the project's \"sustained, powerful influence\" on the field. The review describes \"substantial\" impact contingent on risk mitigation, which suggests a weaker score is warranted.\n\n### Summary:\nThis review demonstrates inconsistent scoring logic, with descriptions of significant weaknesses paired with relatively strong scores. The review lacks specific citations to proposal sections, aims, or methodological details that would ground the critique in evidence. The human subjects concerns are overstated without confirming whether protections are actually missing versus underdescribed. Most importantly, the overall impact score appears inflated given the cumulative weaknesses identified across all review factors.\n\nSpecific improvements needed:\n1. Align scores with the severity of weaknesses described\n2. Provide specific evidence from the proposal text\n3. Clarify whether identified gaps are actual omissions or insufficient detail\n4. Recalculate overall impact to reflect factor scores\n5. Remove speculation about what \"should\" be in the proposal versus what is actually present\n\nBest regards,\nNIH_claude_opus4, AI Assistant",

In this revised review, I address all of these critiques explicitly and provide a fully integrated, analytic justification for each factor and the overall impact score.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** Policy Priorities and Approaches for the Clinical Use of Whole Genome Sequencing  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** R01 (inferred from structure and aims)\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)  \n**Score:** 5\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe proposal addresses a pressing and recognized gap in the policy oversight of clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS), as evidenced by numerous references in the application to the current regulatory frameworks' inadequacy for emerging genomic technologies (Research Strategy, A. SIGNIFICANCE). The aims are clear: (1) to conduct a comprehensive landscape analysis of the U.S. WGS industry, (2) to identify and prioritize novel policy questions using a modified Delphi process, and (3) to develop policy options regarding test quality, reimbursement, and intellectual property domains. The project is innovative in applying a modified Delphi process to the policy space, directly engaging key stakeholders and aiming to produce actionable recommendations (Research Strategy, B. INNOVATION). However, the application presents significant gaps in clarifying how these prioritized questions and policy proposals will be translated into implemented, enforceable policy, and does not identify mechanisms for overcoming known barriers to adoption by regulatory bodies and professional organizations. These weaknesses significantly limit the likelihood that the outputs will exert a powerful and sustained influence, despite the high relevance and timeliness of the research topic.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)  \n**Score:** 5\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe research plan provides a logical, if somewhat high-level, structure for systematically gathering and synthesizing expert opinion (Research Strategy, C. Approach, C.3 Aim 2). The proposed sequential landscape analysis and modified Delphi process (p. 106-108) are methodologically appropriate for policy research, and the plan to recruit 40 panel members from a broad cross-section of stakeholders is reasonable. That said, the application does not offer detailed strategies for ensuring panel retention or addressing participant attrition, nor for maintaining reproducibility and transparency across iterative Delphi rounds. There is no explicit plan for statistical power or sample size justification for Delphi rounds, nor detail on how qualitative and quantitative outputs will be analyzed and integrated. While the proposal states that panelists will be selected to ensure breadth and expertise, the process for monitoring conflicts of interest is only implied and not specified (Research Strategy, C.3). Human subjects protections are referenced in the context of confidentiality of interview data, but IRB approval and a clear consent plan for Delphi participants are either not described or are lacking in detail; this is a significant shortcoming rather than a simple omission.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)  \n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe named investigators and advisory board provide recognized expertise in genetic testing policy, law, health outcomes, and stakeholder engagement (Research Strategy, C.1 Research team and advisory board, p. 105-106). Institutional support from the Genetics and Public Policy Center, Duke, and CMTP is well documented. While specific administrative or data infrastructure detail is minimal, there is no evidence of a major deficiency in team expertise or available institutional resources. However, the application only briefly references prior experience with Delphi methodology and could be strengthened by more detail on team members’ experience with this specific consensus-building and policy translation method. Overall, expertise and available infrastructure meet the threshold for sufficiency, though greater specificity—for example, describing relevant data management capabilities or dedicated project coordination support—would improve confidence.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA  \n- **Human Subjects:** The study includes human subjects in the form of both interviews and ongoing Delphi panel participation. The proposal discusses de-identification and confidentiality for qualitative interview data, but does not include explicit documentation or description of IRB approval or informed consent for all panel participants. This is a material deficiency in the application as reviewed.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not discussed.\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** The proposal does not address authentication or management of data or analytic outputs as critical resources for future policy and research use. Although not applicable to biological reagents in this context, documentation for data security and analytic reproducibility is expected.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:** The narrative does not provide a detailed account of the budget, so appropriateness cannot be directly evaluated. There is no discussion in the provided text regarding contingency funding for participant incentives, travel, or data management.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)  \n**Score:** 5\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe proposal presents a timely and conceptually innovative approach to informing policy development for clinical use of WGS, with clear aims and a broad stakeholder engagement strategy. However, the full potential impact is limited by substantial weaknesses in the depth of methodological detail, insufficient planning for human subjects protections, lack of mechanisms to translate findings to policy adoption, and absent resource management descriptions. These deficiencies considerably reduce confidence that the project will exert a sustained or transformative effect on clinical genomics policy, justifying a score in the middle of the scale. The overall impact is thus better described as moderate, reflecting noteworthy strengths in significance but offset by gaps across rigor, feasibility, and implementation planning.\n\n---\n\nThank you for your detailed critique and the opportunity to align this review more closely with NIH standards and proposal text.\n\nSincerely,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1, AI Assistant",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_claude_opus4, AI assistant. I have carefully analyzed NIH_gpt_4.1's revised review and identified several critical issues that require attention:\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:\nThe revised score of 5 represents significant improvement in calibration compared to the original score of 3. However, the justification still contains a critical weakness: the reviewer speculates about \"mechanisms for overcoming known barriers to adoption by regulatory bodies\" without citing specific text indicating whether the proposal addresses implementation pathways. This assumption about missing content should be reframed as an observation about what is present or explicitly absent in the proposal text.\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:\nThe score of 5 is now better aligned with the mixed strengths and weaknesses described. However, two issues persist:\n1. The critique about \"no explicit plan for statistical power or sample size justification for Delphi rounds\" misapplies quantitative research standards to a qualitative consensus methodology where statistical power calculations are not standard practice.\n2. The statement about IRB approval being \"either not described or lacking in detail\" is problematically vague—the reviewer should definitively state whether IRB documentation is present or absent based on the proposal text.\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:\nThe \"Sufficient\" rating is appropriate and now properly justified. The reviewer appropriately notes that while more detail on Delphi methodology experience would strengthen confidence, the threshold for sufficiency is met.\n\n### Additional Criteria:\nThe human subjects section correctly identifies a material deficiency regarding IRB approval and informed consent documentation. However, the reviewer should clarify whether this represents complete absence of such documentation or insufficient detail, as this distinction affects the severity of the weakness.\n\n### Overall Impact:\nThe overall score of 5 now logically follows from the component ratings (5, 5, Sufficient). The justification appropriately synthesizes strengths and weaknesses. However, the phrase \"transformative effect\" sets an exceptionally high bar that may not align with standard NIH impact expectations for policy research.\n\n### Summary:\nThis revised review demonstrates substantial improvement in evidence grounding, score calibration, and acknowledgment of methodological appropriateness. The remaining weaknesses are:\n1. Occasional speculation about content not verified as present/absent in the proposal\n2. Misapplication of quantitative standards to qualitative methodology\n3. Imprecise language about what is missing versus inadequately described\n4. Potentially inflated expectations for policy research impact\n\nThe review would benefit from: (1) clearer distinction between absent versus inadequate content, (2) recognition of appropriate methodological standards for policy/Delphi research, and (3) more precise citation of proposal sections when making critical observations.\n\nSincerely,\nNIH_claude_opus4, AI Assistant",
