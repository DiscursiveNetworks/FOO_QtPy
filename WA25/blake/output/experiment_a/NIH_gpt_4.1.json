The extent to which genomics will improve health outcomes on a \npopulation level, however,\ndepends in part on effective oversight. The volume of information generated by \nWGS and the uncertainty about\nthe utility of the data, the indications for which it should be used, who will \npay for it, and the extent to which\npatents and licensing affect access are all issues that command the attention of  \nthe policy community. The\ncurrent regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing and \nnewborn screening was not\ndesigned to integrate WGS into clinical practice. Thus, new policy approaches \nmay be required ta establish a\nsystem that guarantees appropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data \nand valid reports while\nencouraging innovation. The proposed study will respond directly to the program \nannouncement PA-11-250 to\nbegin to prioritize and address the unique policy challenges raised by WGS using  \na systematic consultation\nthat could be applied to future regulatory work in this area.\nWe have organized a group with expertise in three of the domains where WGS poses  \nunique challenges:\noversight of test quality and services; patenting and licensing issues; and the \ncoverage and reimbursement of\nWS. In consultation with an expert stakeholder panel, we will systematically \ndelineate and prioritize an\nauthcritative list of specific, tractable questions that policymakers should \nconsider as WGS comes to the clinic.\nWe will select three high-priority questions within our three domains, and work \nwith the panel to develop policy\napproaches to address them. This work will be informed by an initial landscape \nanalysis of the current and\nnear-future status of he WGS industry, as described by several of its leaders. \nBuilding on our team's expertise\nand extensive experience in both genetic testing policy and stakeholder \nengagement methods, we propose the\nfollowing aims to answer the call for regulatory science needed to inform \ndecision making in the face of rapid\ndevelopments in genomic healthcare.\nAim 1. Describe the current whole genome sequencing industry to establish a \nbasis for identifying\nand addressing related policy issues. To provide a clear understanding of WGS, \nwe will conduct the first\nU.S-centered landscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing on the \ngeneration, delivery, and\ninterpretation of genomic data. A review of literature, websites and company \nmaterials will be enhanced by\ninterviewing industry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS.\nAim 2. Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole genome \nsequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nto iteratively engage key siakeholders. Using our landscape analysis, our \ninterview data, and our\nknowledge of current standards and peclicy, we will develop a preliminary list \nof policy questions unique to\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nthe clinical use of WGS. A panel of 40 key stakeholders will then be iteratively  \nsurveyed to add to and refine\nthis list and to rank the resulting questions in terms of importance and \ntractability. An authoritative list of clear\npolicy priorities related to the clinical use WGS will result.\nWe will then develop policy approaches to address three high-priority issues, \none from each area of our team's\nexpertise: test quality and validity, healthcare reimbursement, and intellectual  \nproperty. We will systematically\nanalyze the extent to which current laws, professional guidelines, and industry \nstandards contribute to or\naddress the selected questions. Using this analysis as a starting point, we will  \nagain iteratively survey\nstakeholders to solicit and refine a variety of policy approaches to the \nquestions. The resulting set of\napproaches will be discussed by the stakeholder panel at a summit meeting to \nidentify areas of agreement and\nreasons for disagreement. A report summarizing how our methods and findings \nmight be applied to the\nbroader range of WGS policy issues will be developed and disseminated.\nAim 3. Disseminate findings to policymakers and key stakeholders. Beginning with  \nthe landscape\nanalysis, we will distribute our findings in concise, accessible formats (e.g., \nwhite papers, briefs, webcasts) to a\nbroad range of stakeholders to inform policy development. Two public briefings \nfor Washington-based\npolicymakers will be held to disseminate findings fram the Delphi process. \nFollow-up meetings with select\nfederal officials, Gongressional members and staff will be used to begin focused  \ndialogues on clinical WGS.\nSpecific Aims Page 101\n============================================================\nPage 2\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nRESEARCH STRATEGY\nA. SIGNIFICANCE\nThis application responds directly to one of the primary goals of the NHGRI \nprogram announcement \"Ethical,\nLegal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Genomic Research Regular Research \nProgram\" (PA-11-250},' which\nreads \"New legal and regulatory approaches need to be crafted in anticipation of  \nor in response to rapid\ndevelopments in genomic research and genomic health care....Research will be \nneeded to explore the effects\nof existing policies and regulations and to provide data to inform the \ndevelopment of new policies and\nregulatory approaches.â \nRapid innovation in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has brought us \nwhole genome sequencing\n(WWGS) that can be generated quickly and cheaply enough to be used for clinical \npurposes. In 1996, President\nClinton tantalized the public when he said: â I think it won't be too many \nyears before parents will be able to\ngo home from the hospital with their newborn babies with a genetic map in their \nhands that will tell them,\nhere's what your child's future will likely be like.â  Jay Flatley, CEO of \nIllumina, predicted that WGS would be\nâ technically feasible and affordableâ  by 2014 and â routineâ  by 2019.    \nExactly five years ago, in October 2008,\nthe cost of sequencing an entire human genome was $10.4 million; today it is \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n1,000 times less expensive.Â° The\nNHGRI has recently committed an additional $18 million to spur development of \nfaster technologies.* Some\nresearchers predict that five years from now it will be possible to sequence an \nentire human genome in a\nmatter of hours for $100 or less.*Â°\nDemonstrating the clinica] potential of these new technologies, whole exome \nsequencing (WES) and WGS\nhave already been used successfully to diagnose and treat disease,â  Â° and \ninsurance companies have agreed\nto cover the cost of WGS in at least two cases.\"' A growing number of diagnostic  \nlaboratories are adding next-\ngeneration sequencing to their menu of services.'* Some experts think genomic \nsequencing is ready for\nroutine clinical use.'*\"*\nAlthough the technology had advanced to the point where it can be used address \nspecific clinical questions an\nemerging consensus that the U.S. health care system does not have an established  \nsystem of procedures,\nknowledge and resources to effectively interpret and deliver WGS information to \npatients and providers.\nThe extent to which genomic medicine improves health outcames on a population \nlevel will depend on the\neffective oversight of clinical WGS. The current regulatory framework that \nguides single-gene diagnostic\ntesting and newborn screening were not designed with the complexity of whole \ngenome sequencing in mind,\nand will not suffice without new approaches or creative applications of existing  \npolicy.\nEric Green and Mark Guyer recently wrote that \"the amount and heterogeneous \nnature of the data, which will\ninclude both expected and unexpected results, will antiquate current mechanisms \nfor delivering medical\ninformation to patientsâ .'Â° The mechanisms currently in place are themselves \nthe result of extensive research\nio craft a system of regulatory policies that guide the practice of genetic \ntesting.'Â® The nature and character\nof the data referred to by Drs. Green and Guyer would seem to necessitate a call  \nfor forward-thinking policy\nresearch and guidance. New policy approaches will be needed to establish a \nsystem that promotes\nappropriate, broad access to high-quality sequence data and valid reports while \nencouraging innovation.\nWGS's rapid transition to clinical use has prompted a wide range of initiatives,  \nincluding NIHâ s National Genter \nfor Advancing Translational Sciences,\"* and NHGRIâ s most recent ELSI program \nannouncement, '? and\nheightened the importance of efforts like the FDA and NIH's collaborative \nregulatory science initiative*Â° and the\nGenetic Testing Registry. In June 2011, the FDA held a public meeting to discuss  \napproaches to establish the\nsafety and effectiveness of clinical genomic sequencing. Likewise, insurers and \npharmacy benefits managers\nare creating positions for the management of genomics services.\nThere are numerous policy needs that require the attention of stakeholder groups  \nwith diverse, strong\ninterests in the governance of WGS. Among the many challenges we face are: \nensuring the quality and utility\nof WGS data and interpretation; defining the indications for which WGS should be  \nused; determining whe will\npay for it; developing systems of patents and licensing that maximize access \nwhile rewarding innovation; the\nResearch Strategy Page 102\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n============================================================\nPage 3\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nstorage and integration of data into medical records; issues of ownership and \nprivacy; personnel and training\nneeds; and whether the technology is best used for diagnostic purposes or health  \nscreening.\nWe have organized a research team with expertise in three of these domains: the \noversight of test quality and\nservices; patenting and licensing issues; and the coverage and reimbursement of \nmolecular diagnostics. WGS\nis likely to raise several important questions in each of these areas. How \nshould a WGS test, which could\nsimultaneously produce a result with clear utility, a result with unintended \nconsequences, and a result whose\ninterpretation will change with future research, be categorized under the FDA's \nproposed risk-based approach\nio regulation?â Â° How will insurers address the complexity of the information \ncreated by WGS technology? Will\nthe lack of clinical utility data limit or prevent coverage? Will clinical \nlaboratories be able to offer a camplete\ngenome sequence when some of the genomic landscape is restricted by intellectual  \nproperty patents?*' Are\nlicensing restrictions likely to reduce the utility of the available sequence?\nWith little empiric data available to answer such questions, there is a large \ndegree of uncertainty about the\nnature and relative importance of these policy domains. However there is an \nimmediate need for critical\nthought about what the policy priorities are and how we may begin to address \nthem.\nIn the absence of data about the validity, accuracy or utility of WGS, or how \nstrong the enforcement of patent\nclaims against WGS laboratories will we will develop a set of policy priorities \nfor clinical WGS by consulting a\ndiverse group of stakeholders, including WGS technology and informatics \ncompanies, clinical laboratories,\nhealth care professionals, insurers, regulatory and public health agencies, \nhealth economists, and patient\ngroups. The findings of this study will be driven primarily by the experiences \nand opinions of experts who are\ncurrently developing, monitoring and regulating the tools and technology for the  \nclinical use of WGS\nA modified Delphi process will be to elicit expert stakeholdersâ  input on all \nrelevant policy issues and their\nrelative importance and tractability. This highly structured approach to \nstakeholder engagement allows a\ngeographically and professionally diverse group of experts to anonymously \nprovide one another with\nquantitative and qualitative feedback about the ideas of others on the panel. \nAnalysis of this feedback can lead\nto a prioritized list of WGS issues as defined by the entire community of \nstakeholders, or a detailed critique of\npolicy options to address a given policy problem. Points of agreement between \nstakeholders and reasons for\ndisagreement can be identified. To ensure that this work is based on an \nunderstanding of the actual\ncapabilities and business models of WGS companies, we will begin by conducting \nthe first U.S-centered\nlandscape analysis of the current WGS industry, focusing an the generation, \ndelivery, and interpretation of\ngenomic data. Throughout the course of the study we will distribute our findings  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nin concise formats that are\naccessible to policymakers.\nConducting policy planning now, as this rapidly-advancing technology begins to \nmature, presents an\nopporiunity to evaluate and influence both the industry and policy options. This  \nwork will help to ensure that\npolicymakers have sound access to existing evidence and policy options based on \nwide-ranging expert\nopinions and rigorous research. A significant portion of the impact of this \nproject will come from active efforts to\ndisseminate our findings to policymakers in order to stimulate discussion and \ninform efforts to enact\nappropriate regulatory reform.\nB. Innovation\n[[This proposal is innovative in four ways. First, it will be one of the first \ncomprehensive projects to\nsystematically assess U.S. policy needs since whole genome sequencing (WGS) has \nbecome available for\nclinical use.'*'Â° Conducting policy work now, just as WGS is becoming \nclinically available and before this\nrapidly-advancing technology matures, will allow us to consider policy questions  \nas they arise in real time, and\noffers the prospect of influencing the early practices and expectations of those  \ninvolved with clinical WGS. Ta\ndate, policy work related to the clinical use of WGS has been largely \ntheoretical. Our propased policy analysis\nis innovative in that it is based on direct engagement with WGS campanies and \nother key stakeholders. This\nwill ensure a forward-looking description of the WGS industry, and the \nproduction of policy priorities and\napproaches that are grounded in a broad range of highly relevant experiences. ]]\nResearch Strategy Page 103\n============================================================\nPage 4\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nSecond, most policy work to date has focused on issues primarily related to \nsingle gene testing and is typically\nlimited to a single policy domain. This proposal explores and prioritizes the \nmast pressing policy questions\nacross three major areas: quality assurance, reimbursement, and patents and \nlicensing. The breadth and\ndepth of the project staff's expertise facilitates the simultaneous development \nof policy approaches in these\ndomains. By disseminating the policy priorities, we hope to stimulate the \ndevelopment of policy approaches\namong experts in other areas such as equitable access to services, privacy, and \ndata access and storage.\n[[Third, we propose using an innovative modified Delphi approach to ensure the \nsystematic incorporation of a\nwide range of highly relevant perspectives in our priority setting and policy \ndevelopment. Members of the\nstakeholder panel anonymously review and propose revisions to other panel \nmembers' ideas as the study\nprogresses. The results are conclusions that have been vetted from many \ndifferent perspectives at a high level.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of each policy approach, as viewed by the range of \nstakeholders will be of\ntremendous value as policymakers and stakeholders begin earnest discussions to \nguide the implementation of\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nW6GS. lf the Delphi process is successful and productive, it could result in the  \nestablishment of a framework,\nor methodological pipeline, to evaluate additional WGS policy issues moving \nforward.]]\nFinally, the direct dissemination of findings to the policy community will \nincrease the uptake and use of this\nwork. Washington-based policy briefings, issue briefs, and online media tools \nwill be used to distribute our\nlandscape analysis, policy priorities, policy approaches, and an account of the \nDelphi process. The expertise of\nBurness Communications will help to ensure the success of our outreach efforts.\nC. Approach\nWe plan to combine straightforward methods of landscape and policy analysis with  \na modified Delphi process,\nin which a diverse panel of key stakeholders are iteratively surveyed for their \nopinions and feedback, to\nsystematically identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\nto develop policy approaches to address the most pressing, tractable issues, as \njudged by our\nstakeholder panel. As with all policy analysis, the first step is to identify \nand clearly define the process being\ngoverned and the nature of the issues that need to be addressed. We will begin \nin Aim 1 by conducting the\nfirst systematic, landscape analysis of the current WGS industry to clearly \ndefine the business methods and\nservices involved in that are being employed to commercialize clinical WGS. To \ninform the development of\nforward-thinking policy, and gain first-hand knowledge of emerging business \nmodels, we will interview\nindustry leaders about the future of commercial clinical WGS. This innovative, \ncomprehensive landscape\nanalysis will provide a framework for identifying and prioritizing novel policy \nquestions, outlining policy-\nrelevant aspects of the WGS industry including self-imposed quality standards, \ncapabilities and services\nbeing offered, targeted indications and markets, patents held and health claims \nbeing made. This\nassessment of the industry's approaches to clinical sequencing will directly \ninform the development and\nprioritization of major policy issues related to WGS in Aim 2.\n[[In Aim 2 we will engage a diverse panel of experts to define and prioritize \nmajor policy issues related to\nWGS. A preliminary list of policy questions will be generated from the landscape  \nanalysis and our\nknowledge of current standards and policy. We will use a modified Delphi process  \nto systematically collect\nand integrate the opinions of ~40 key stakeholders. A modified Delphi process \nadds an in-person meeting\nof stakeholders and project staff to the traditional process of iterative \nstakeholder surveys.â  The \nstakeholder panel will be drawn from the WGS industry, including WGS technolagy \ncompanies, infarmatics\ncompanies, trade associations, and clinical laboratories; the health care \nsystem, including public and private\ninsurers, pharmacy benefits managers, healthcare systems, provider groups, \nprofessional associations,\nclinical geneticists, and genetic counselors; and policymakers, academics and \nthe public, including\nregulatory and public health agencies (FDA, FTC, CMS, HHS, PTO, CDC, Congress), \nhealth economists,\npatient groups, and intellectual property expert.***? Stakehalders will be \niteratively surveyed (see Figure 1).\nThe results of each survey will be summarized and analyzed by project staff, and  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nreturned ta the panel\nmembers for criticism and comment in the following round. A final in-person \nmeeting will be used to gather\nmore detailed opinions about policy approaches to three high priority questions \nThis process will result in\nthree products: (1) a prioritized list of policy questions for consideration by \nthe policy community, (2) policy\napproaches developed to address three of the most pressing issues as defined by \nthe panel, and {3} a\nsummary of the Delphi process as a technique for developing these approaches. \nThe policy priorities and\nResearch Strategy Page 104\n============================================================\nPage 5\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nthe resulting set of draft approaches will be disseminated in a timely and \naccessible fashion to federal and\nsiate regulators, genome technology developers, investors, health care \nproviders, and other stakeholder\ngroups in Aim 3.]] A preliminary list of stakeholders is found in the Appendix.\nThis project will leverage the expertise, insight, and working relationships \nestablished by an accomplished\nstudy team and a diverse panel of stakeholders to efficiently and \ncomprehensively collect and analyze\ninformation relevant to WGS policy decisions. In this section we describe: (1) \nthe research team and expert\nadvisory board; (2) the research plan and timeline; (3) potential limitations of  \nthe study; and (4} a brief\nsummary of relevant preliminary work.\nC.1 Research team and advisory board\nThe research team will be led by David Kaufman and Amy McGuire, who combine \nsignificant expertise\nin genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics with extensive experience \nengaging stakeholders and developing\nand disseminating policy options.*** Analysis of the oversight of WGS quality \nwill be led by Gail Javitt, one of\nthe nationâ s foremost experts on FDA law and CMS/CLIA regulation of genetic \ntesting quality and utility. Ms.\nJavitt led the Genetic Testing Quality Initiative at the Genetics and Public \nPolicy Center, which identified gaps\nin federal oversight of single-gene genetic test quality and delivered \nrecommendations to policymakers using a\nwide variety of formats. More recently she published recommendations for a \nblueprint of a genetic test\nregistryÂ®â  and led the GPPC effort to evaluate the policy implications of DTC   \ngenetic testing.â  This proposal \nbuilds on Ms. Javitt's prior work by applying her detailed knowledge of the \nregulatory bodies that have\njurisdiction over genetic testing to quality assurance issues raised by next-\ngeneration sequencing methods with\ndifferent standards, data output, reports and error rates.\nIssues of intellectual property, technology transfer, and relevant aspects of \npolicy engagement will be\naddressed by Robert Gook-Deegan, who is the director of the Duke University \nCenter for Genome Ethics, Law\n& Policy, and a leading expert on the effects of patents and licensing practices  \non genetic testing. Since 2009,\nDr. Gook-Deegan has published an extensive number of peer-reviewed articles \nrelated to human gene\n\n--- Page 8 ---\npatenting. Among his many contributions to the field are patent case studies \nthat served as the basis for the\n2010 SAGGHS Report on Gene Patents and Licensing Practices and Their Impact on \nPatient Access to\nGenetic Tests. The study will extend his work to consider policy approaches to \npatent and licensing issues\npresented by clinical applications of WGS.\nSean Tunis, Pat Deverka, and Donna Messner of the Center for Medical Technology \nPolicy (CMTP}) in\nBaltimore, MD, will address issues of insurance coverage and reimbursement \npolicies for WGS. As founder\nand Director of GMTP, Dr. Tunis is a recognized leader in the assessment of \nmedical technologies, including\nmolecular diagnostics, and the development of guidance for insurance coverage of  \nthese tools. As the Chief\nMedical Officer at CMS, he supervised the development of national coverage \npolicies and quality standards for\nthe adoption of new technologies by Medicare and Medicaid providers. He is \njoined by Dr. Deverka, an expert\nin the identification of policy approaches to improve the clinical translation \nof personalized medicine. At CMTP,\nDr. Deverka is currently engaging stakeholders on several projects related to \npersonalized medicine which use\nDelphi panels and other methods to set priorities for care. [[Dr. Messner is a \nspecialist in qualitative social\nresearch methods, including stakeholder engagement methodologies and use of the \nDelphi process to gather\nopinions on topics including FDA regulation, genetic testing, and gene \npatenting. Dr. Messner will lead the\nselection of the stakeholder panel and development of the Delphi process. ]]\nIn addition, an eight-member expert advisory board will provide guidance \nthroughout the project. [This advisary\nboard is distinct from the key stakeholder panel (Delphi panel) that we will \nengage in the Delphi pracess; its\nfunction is to serve as a sounding board for project staff, and to advise the \nproject on dissemination of\nfindings]. Letters of agreement for the advisory board members are attached. \nAdvisory board members\ninclude: Jim Evans, a physician and molecular biologist at the University of \nNorth Carolina School of Medicine,\nand Director of UNC's Clinical Cancer Genetics Services; George Church, an \ninnovator in genome sequencing\ntechnology and the Director of the Center for Computational Genetics and the \nPersonal Genome Project, and\nfounder of Knome Inc; Dietrich Stephan, the co-founder of Navigenics and a \npioneer in the development cf\nnew business models for genetic testing; Arti Rai, a renowned legal scholar at \nDuke University who served as\ndirector of external relations for the US Patent and Trademark Office; [[David \nVeenstra, an associate professor\nResearch Strategy Page 105\n============================================================\nPage 6\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nof pharmaceutical outcomes research at the University of Washington and an \nestablished scholar on the\neconomic implications of pharmacogenomics; Sarah Botha, an attorney in the \nBureau of Cansumer Protection\nat the Federal Trade Commission where she has focused on consumersâ  legal \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nrights and protections when\npurchasing genetic tests; Jonathan Rothberg, the founder and CEO of 454 Life \nSciences and lon Torrent, two\nof the largest companies responsible for current advances in sequencing \ntechnology; and Heidi Williams, an\nAssistant Professor of Economics at MIT where she is an expert on the economics \nof innovation in genome-\nrelated markets. ]]\nThe advisory board will meet five times during the course of the study via \nInternet-based video\nteleconierencing to minimize travel expense and burden. The first meeting at the  \noutset of the study will clarify\nstudy goals. At the second meeting the research team will present WGS landscape \nanalysis and discuss\nrelevant policy questions. In year two the board will help to select three \nissues to develop policy approaches\nfor, based on results from the Delphi process, and define criteria that should \nbe considered when developing\nthe policies. Towards the end of year two, the panel will review the approaches \ndeveloped through the Delphi\nsurveys. Finally, the research team will update the board on major findings, \nsolicit ideas for dissemination, and\ndiscuss plans for future research.

We will include\ncompanies, universities and other entities developing whole genome sequencing \ntechnologies and equipment,\nproviding sequencing services (whole or exomic), or offering clinical annotation  \nor interpretation of sequence\ndata.

We will classify the range \nof business models used to\npromote and deliver WGS based on the policy-relevant information we collect. We \nwill refine and narrow\nResearch Strategy Page 106\n============================================================\nPage 7\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\nour definition of WGS companies, eliminating any that are not offering relevant \nproducts or services. The\nlandscape report will include sections identifying the companies, the service \nmodels for clinical WGS, the\nmarkets being addressed, and who is paying for the services.\n[Interviews with industry leaders: WGS business models and technologies are \nchanging rapidly. To anticipate\nthese developments as we draft policy approaches, project staff at GPPC will \nconduct semi-structured\ninterviews with a purposive sample of up to 20 industry leaders to seek their \nperspectives on the future of\nclinical WGS. Interviews will not ask leaders about specific business plans, as \nthis information is unlikely to be\ndivulged. We will recruit chief executives and senior scientific and business \nofficers from companies identified\nin the landscape analysis. Recruitment will cease when saturation of interview \nfindings occurs or 20 interviews\nare completed. Based on GPPC and CMTP's experience recruiting scientists and \nprofessional stakeholders for\nother interview studies, we believe we will be able to enroll 20 individuals \nfrom what we expect will be at least\n40 companies with at least three eligible staff each.\nAn interview guide will be drafted, piloted among advisory board members, and \nrevised. The guide will contain\na small number of general questions designed to evoke a conversational tone and \nelicit opinions about the\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nfuture directions of clinical WGS. Questions might include how participants \nthink WGS is most likely to be\nintegrated into care, or what companies need to do to prepare for the many \npossible clinical uses of WGS. We\nwill also use this opportunity to collect information about industry standards \nand self-regulatian. Telephone\ninterviews lasting 30-40 minutes will be audio taped using two recording devices  \nto prevent data loss. All\ninterview materials will be de-identified and kept confidential; no data will be  \nreported on the individual level.\nTapes will be transcribed. After all personal identifiers are deleted, \ntranscripts will be entered into the\nqualitative data analysis software NVivo version 9.0. We will apply an \nabbreviated content/thematic analysis to\nassimilate the interview data: a fairly simple coding scheme will be applied to \ncode transcripts for major themes\nrelated to the future of clinical WGS {e.g., \"emerging business modelsâ  or \nâ pathways to clinical integration\").\nThe entire research team will meet to review the coded transcripts, discuss the \nthemes that emerged, and\nintegrate the findings into the landscape analysis.\nEffective evaluation of the policy and oversight implications of WGS will \nrequire careful, ongoing monitoring of\nthe industry throughout the study to identify new entrants into the marketplace.  \nThroughout the course of the\nstudy we will search for emerging companies and business models, and we will \ndocument changes in existing\nWGS companies by regularly collecting screen shots of Web sites showing test \nofferings and changes in\nservices.]]\nffC.3 Aim 2: Identify and prioritize novel policy questions posed by whole \ngenome sequencing, and\ndevelop policy approaches for the most pressing, tractable issues using a \nmodified Delphi process\nthat iteratively engages key stakeholders. [[Note to reviewers: this Aim is new \nand replaces a more\ntraditional policy analysis.j}\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty about how whole genome sequencing will be \nincorporated into clinical\nmedicine, both generally and in the United Statesâ  healthcare complex. There \nis a general consensus that\nwhole genome sequencing will disrupt the patchwork of systems that currently \nguide clinical single-gene\ntesting and newborn screening, including existing codes and policies for \nreimbursement and insurance\ncoverage, appropriate indications for testing, standards to ensure genetic test \nquality, and intellectual\nproperty rights.

The buy-in of these \norganizations, aur interviews with\nindustry leaders in Aim 1, our dissemination of the landscape analysis to \npolicymakers (Aim 3),and the\npresence of industry and thought leaders on the advisory panel will all serve as  \ncatalysts for additional\nrecruitment. ]]\nPreparation of the Delphi Panel and Delphi Materials: Maintaining panel \nmembersâ  anonymity in their \nSurvey responses encourages unconventional or unexpected ideas and questions.*Â°  \nHence, each panel\nmember will be assigned a two letter code that panel members and study staff \nwill use to refer to each\nother during the surveys.â * However, complete anonymity can undermine the \nprocess; participants need\nconfidence that their fellow participants are respected peers. A brief group \nbuilding exercise will be\nconducted at the outset to develop this confidence. Panel members will be asked \nto submit their names,\n\n--- Page 14 ---\naffiliations, and areas of expertise, as well as their concerns and hopes for \nthe Delphi process. A summary\nof this information will be disseminated to all participants. Panel members will  \nalso be sent the landscape\nanalysis from Aim 1, which will provide important context for the identification  \nand consideration of policy\nquestions. The initial surveys for both problem identification and the \ndevelopment of policy approaches will\nbe carefully developed ahead of time by staff and piloted with advisory board \nmembers. Instruments for the\nlater rounds will be determined by the panel responses.\nIdentification and prioritization of novel policy questions posed by WGS: The \nstakeholder panel and project\nStaff will engage in two rounds of input to clearly identify and prioritize \nunique policy questions related to the\nclinical use of WGS. Prior to the first round of the Delphi process, the entire \nstudy team, in consultation with\nthe advisory board, will use our landscape analysis and our knowledge of current  \nstandards and policy to\ndevelop a preliminary list of novel policy questions we believe are raised by \nclinical WGS. This â straw \nmodelâ  of policy questions will be submitted to panel members for \nconsideration as the first survey.\nParticipants will be asked to review the issues, add issues, comment on any \nissues they wish, and rate the\nimportance, validity, and technical and political feasibility of addressing each  \nissue using 5-point Likert\nscales.â \"' The use of these scales does not exclude other forms of \nclassification of the policy questions;\nwe will consider the findings of our landscape analysis and recommendations of \nthe advisory panel to\nidentify other measures by which these questions might be categorized.\nThe team will assess and summarize the responses. The resulting annotated list \nof policy questions will be\npresented back to the panel, who will use a second online survey to review the \nissues, make additional\ncomments, and again rate the importance, validity, and technical and political \nfeasibility of addressing each\nissue. The feedback will be summarized to produce an annotated list of policy \nquestions. The questions will\nbe prioritized using the ranked scale data. Numerical values for importance and \nvalidity will be summed to\nform a \"Priority\" scale ranging from 0 to 8, while values for technical \nfeasibility will be summed to form a\n\"Tractabilityâ  scale ranging from 0 to 8. An Overall scale summing all four \nitems (range 0-16) will also be\ntallied. Median values for the individual and combined scales will be calculated  \nfor each policy question.\nNumerical priority rankings will be computed after sorting the list of questions  \nby median Overall rating, then\nPriority. A second list of ratings will be computed, sorting by Overall rating \nfollowed by Tractability. An\nannotated, ranked, sortable list of priorities with median values of each \ncomposite and individual scale will\nbe published and disseminated in a variety of formats to the broader stakeholder  \ncommunities to inform the\ndevelopment of WGS-related policy.\nResearch Strategy Page 109\n============================================================\nPage 10\nSection: Research Strategy\n============================================================\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nDevelopment of multiple policy approaches to address the most pressing, \ntractable issues in our areas of\nexpertise: The goal of generating policy approaches is to provide policymakers \nand others with several\nalternatives to address policy needs for the effective integration of WGS. \nIdeally, alternative approaches vary in\nterms of timing, mechanism, distribution of burden, extent of federal and state \ngovernment involvement, and\nstakeholder support. The second round of the Delphi process will be used to \ndevelop approaches that might\nnot have emerged from a less structured stakeholder conversation that could be \nled or dominated by members\nwith particular viewpoints. The process will also provide a detailed \nunderstanding of where various factions\nconverge and diverge, and the nature of disagreements. These data help to \nidentify aspects of policy that will\nrequire negotiation and compromise.\nSelection of the policy questions to address: We have organized a team with \nexpertise in three policy areas\nidentified by the program announcement as important to the success of clinical \nWGS - analytic validity and\ntesting quality (GPPC), patenting and licensing (Duke}, and reimbursement and \npayment (CMTP}. We will\naddress the most important, tractable issue identified by the panel in each of \nthese three categories. We\nrecognize that the panel will identity several important issues that lie outside  \nof these domains, and we will\nencourage others with appropriate expertise to take up the development of \npolicies to address them. We\nwill consult the advisory board on our choice of issues.\nAnalysis of the current legal and requlatory framework surrounding the three \nselected issues: Each policy\ngroup (GPP, Duke, and GMPT) will prepare an initial evaluation of the current \nfederal and state laws and\nregulations, [[professional and association guidelines, and standards being \nadopted by the WGSj] industry that\napply to the issues being addressed. We will consider the intended purpose of \nthese rules, whether they are\nboth broad and precise enough to address the policy issues being considered. We \nalso will examine whether\nand by whom compliance with existing laws is enforced. Finally, we will \ndetermine whether there are conflicts\nor redundancies between different Jaws and guidelines that may need to be \nresolved. These analyses will be\nwritten up into white papers and disseminated to pane] members to provide them \nwith context for the\ndevelopment of policy approaches. Drs. McGuire and Kaufman will coordinate the \nefforts of the three teams\nfo ensure that they produce comparable evaluations that can be combined and \nexamined together.\nThroughout the study, regular project meetings involving all key staff will be \nconducted to ensure timely\nprogress, as well as comparable goals and products among the different teams.\nDevelopment a range of potential policy approaches: To begin developing policy \nalternatives, Delphi panel\nmembers will be asked to â brainstormâ  in response to the third survey  \nconsisting of open-ended questions\nabout how best to address the three policy issues. Panelists will be asked to \nconsider the landscape of the\nindustry and the current policy environment as well as more specific outcomes \nsuch as the impact on public\nhealth, cost implications for the government and stakeholders, and the impact on  \naccess to WGS and other\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nservices. Additional criteria for consideration may also be identified. The \nproject team will simultaneously\nouiline its own policy approaches using the policy analysis framework developed \nby Patton & Sawicki.*?\nCombining stakeholder input with the project teamâ s approaches, we will \nprepare a straw model of policy\nalternatives to address each issue. Following the policy Delphi approach of,â *  \nthe straw model will take the\nform of a series of resolutions and arguments supporting each resolution. In \nsurvey four, participants will\nrank the desirability and feasibility of each resolution, and the importance and  \nvalidity of each supporting\nargument. Panel members may add resolutions and propose supporting or opposing \narguments for\nresolutions. The staff will \"moderateâ  the discussion by feeding mean and \nmedian rankings, comments and\nsuggestions back to panel members for a final survey to collect rankings and \nfeedback. The staff will\ncambine and summarize comments in the case of identical arguments.\nBefore disseminating the policy approaches more broadly, we will review our \nfindings at an in-person\nmeeting of the Delphi panel members and project staff. This final round of the \nmodified Delphi process will\ntake place over two days in Washington, D.C. Findings, as descr\n\n[... Document truncated due to length ...]",

Below, I provide a formal NIH-style peer review per the guidelines of the Two-Agent NIH Grant Review Framework, using the text you provided for analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not specified in provided text]  \n**PI:** [Presumed David Kaufman and Amy McGuire]  \n**Mechanism:** [Not explicitly indicated; likely R01 given scope]\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Focus:** Significance and Innovation\n\n**Score (1–9):** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe proposal directly addresses critical, emerging challenges in the policy and oversight of clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS), at a time of rapid technological adoption and insufficient regulatory adaptation. The research responds to recognized gaps including quality oversight, reimbursement, and intellectual property, aiming for systematic priority-setting and actionable policy recommendations. Notably, the project’s use of a landscape analysis and a modified Delphi process, involving a diverse stakeholder panel, is conceptualized to generate authoritative new data rather than theoretical discourse. The work stands to have broad impact, informing both U.S. policy and the wider clinical genomics community. While the scope is pragmatic—focused on policy rather than basic or translational genomics science—the research is highly timely and innovative in approach.\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Focus:** Scientific approach, design, reproducibility, inclusion, and feasibility\n\n**Score (1–9):** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe methods are robust, employing a systematic multi-step research design: comprehensive industry landscape analysis, semi-structured stakeholder interviews, and an iterative modified Delphi panel process for priority ranking and policy development. The proposal anticipates and mitigates common challenges in stakeholder research, such as panel recruitment, response attrition, and data confidentiality. The choice to include a broad range of perspectives (industry, clinicians, payers, policy makers, patient groups) strengthens the validity and inclusiveness of the policy recommendations. The investigative team demonstrates relevant methodological expertise and provides explicit detail on rigorous qualitative and policy analytic methods, including thematic coding of interview data and quantitative and qualitative analysis of Delphi panel input. Feasibility is supported by extensive prior experience with stakeholder engagement and Delphi methodology.\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe leadership team is highly qualified, integrating expertise spanning genetic science, clinical policy, bioethics, law, health economics, and stakeholder engagement. Key personnel are recognized authorities in WGS regulatory policy, insurance reimbursement, and gene patenting. The inclusion of an external advisory board with deep domain knowledge and contacts further enhances project guidance and dissemination potential. Institutional resources, partnerships, and documented experience with similar policy projects are appropriately described.\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA (Affect Impact but Not Scored)\n\n**Human Subjects:** Not applicable (policy research, no direct human subject interventions).\n\n**Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n\n**Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n\n**Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not specified; this appears to be a new submission with a revised Aim 2 (noted for reviewers).\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS (Do Not Affect Score)\n\n**Authentication of Key Resources:** The proposal describes use of validated analytic platforms (e.g., NVivo for qualitative analysis) and appropriate selection of expert participants.\n\n**Budget and Period of Support:** Not detailed in provided text; reviewer assumes reasonable support given project scope.\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n\n**Score (1–9):** 2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis proposal demonstrates formidable strength in its recognition of a fast-moving, inadequately-regulated field and presents a rigorous, reproducible strategy for developing actionable policy guidance in clinical WGS. The integration of systematic industry analysis and structured stakeholder processes—led by a first-rate investigative team—supports high feasibility and inclusiveness, with potential for lasting field-wide impact on how genomic medicine is governed. Limitations include a primary focus on U.S. policy contexts and the inherent unpredictability of rapidly evolving science and regulation; however, these aspects are acknowledged and partially addressed via flexible methodologies. Major strengths substantially outweigh minor limitations.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you would like further analysis, the Agent B Critic report, or additional refinement steps.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

All comments are anchored in evidence from the submitted text.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Overall Impact\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe proposal directly responds to a pressing need for evidence-based, regulatory, and policy frameworks tailored to the growing integration of clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) in U.S. healthcare. Through a rigorous combination of landscape analysis and a modified Delphi method involving diverse, influential stakeholders, the project has exceptional potential to articulate actionable priorities and policy strategies. The investigative team demonstrates considerable expertise and prior success in influencing genetic testing policy, lending confidence to the likelihood of successful execution and dissemination.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThe application’s focus is somewhat narrow regarding international policy perspectives, and while the Delphi process is robust, it is dependent on panel participation and buy-in, which can sometimes face unexpected attrition or groupthink. The pathway from recommendations to tangible policy change could be more comprehensively developed.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nStrengthen the discussion of how U.S. policy approaches may inform, or be informed by, international regulatory experiences. Consider including contingency plans for panel recruitment/retention and describe strategies for translating Delphi panel outputs into actionable policy advocacy or pilot implementation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Significance\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe proposal addresses foundational regulatory and policy gaps that threaten to hinder the safe, equitable, and effective implementation of clinical WGS. There is clear alignment with the NHGRI ELSI Program announcement’s objectives, and the emphasis on systematically identifying and prioritizing specific, tractable policy questions is timely and essential. The work is positioned to substantially shape national discourse and decision-making in genomic medicine oversight.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nWhile the proposal clearly identifies major domains (quality, reimbursement, IP), the impact on broader implementation areas—such as equity, data privacy, and secondary use—may be limited since these are not the primary focus.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nExplicitly discuss how findings and frameworks developed in this project could be extended to additional emerging policy domains (e.g., equity, privacy, access), and consider brief plans for catalyzing such extensions in future collaborative efforts.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Investigators\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe PI and co-investigators have outstanding, complementary expertise, covering genetic policy, law, health economics, stakeholder engagement, and social research methods. Their track record in leading national policy initiatives and relevant publications is well-documented. The project benefits from an expert advisory board including leading figures from academia, industry, and government, ensuring robust guidance and reach.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThe leadership team’s capacity to address critical topics beyond their domains (e.g., privacy, international policy) is not as apparent, potentially restricting the project’s breadth.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nEngage additional consultants or collaborators with expertise in areas less represented on the core team, particularly in privacy, international genomics policy, and health equity, to enrich perspectives as policy questions arise in the Delphi process.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Innovation\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe structured use of a two-phase, modified Delphi method—one of the first applications in this policy context—will likely be field-leading. Real-time engagement with industry and stakeholders, as WGS enters the clinic, is both innovative and responsive to current needs. The direct, multichannel dissemination of findings to policymakers maximizes translational value.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nWhile innovative in context, much of the policy work focuses on established domains (quality, reimbursement, IP), possibly missing opportunities to address even more uncharted areas (e.g., dynamic consent, emerging AI/ML in genomics).\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nIncorporate horizon scanning for new or less anticipated domains beyond the three core policy areas; reserve at least one stakeholder panel or advisory board session for identifying such “future frontier” policy needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Approach\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe study design is detailed and methodologically sound. Phase 1’s landscape analysis is appropriately multi-modal (literature review, web searches, semi-structured interviews), offering a comprehensive market and regulatory snapshot. The iterative Delphi process is well-described, with procedures for recruiting, anonymizing, and tracking stakeholder engagement. The analytical strategy for merging qualitative and quantitative data from surveys and meetings is clear.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nPotential limitations arise from selection bias within the stakeholder panel and possible attrition during a 20-month, multi-round process. The impact of industry changes or new entrants during the proposed study period could also affect the relevance of findings.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nSpecify concrete procedures for monitoring and minimizing panel attrition; outline methods for periodically reassessing and updating the panel to reflect new developments or entrants in the field. Plan for regular methodological audits to assure ongoing representativeness and rigor.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Environment\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \nThe investigators’ institutions are among the nation’s leading centers for genomic policy, ethics, and health technology analysis. Access to Burness Communications and existing networks for policy dissemination is an asset. The advisory board and collaborating organizations provide both credibility and practical reach.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \nThere is limited detail on dedicated administrative or analytical support staff and infrastructure to handle the complex, multi-modal data collection and iterative stakeholder process.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \nDescribe in more detail the personnel and informatics resources allocated to qualitative data management, survey distribution, and stakeholder communication. Ensure that infrastructure for secure data handling and remote engagement is state-of-the-art and robust.\n\n---\n\n## Summary & Final Recommendations\n\nThis application offers a meticulously conceived and potentially transformative approach to policy-setting for clinical whole genome sequencing in the U.S. Its principal strengths lie in the exceptional expertise of the team, innovative, participatory methodology, and close alignment with current regulatory priorities. The main limitations involve breadth (potentially omitting emergent policy domains and international perspectives), possible risks in panel composition and retention, and some gaps in implementation planning.  \n\nTo further strengthen the proposal, the applicants should broaden the conceptual framework to include less-explored domains, detail mechanisms for stakeholder panel management and updating, and enhance the plan for translating recommendations into policy action. With these refinements, the project is poised to exert substantial and sustained influence on the governance of clinical genomics.\n\nRespectfully submitted,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Please reflect on this feedback and regenerate your response, addressing the valid concerns while explaining why you might disagree with any points you find incorrect:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_claude_opus4, AI assistant. I will now provide a critical analysis of the review submitted by NIH_gpt_4.1.\n\n---\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:\n**Issue identified:** The reviewer awarded a score of 2 (Outstanding) but failed to adequately discuss innovation as a separate component from significance. The NIH framework explicitly requires assessment of both significance AND innovation under this factor. The review merges these concepts without clearly distinguishing how the proposal advances novel concepts or methods versus addressing important problems.\n\n**Missing elements:** No explicit discussion of conceptual or methodological novelty beyond mentioning \"first applications in this policy context.\" The reviewer should articulate what makes the approach innovative beyond timing.\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:\n**Inconsistency detected:** The reviewer identifies \"potential limitations arise from selection bias\" and \"possible attrition during a 20-month, multi-round process\" as weaknesses, yet still awards a score of 2. These are significant methodological concerns that should result in a lower score (3-4 range) if they truly threaten the study's rigor.\n\n**Procedural error:** The review uses an incorrect NIH review structure. The standard framework specifies three main factors: (1) Importance of Research, (2) Rigor and Feasibility, and (3) Expertise and Resources. However, this review separates these into six scored sections (Overall Impact, Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, Environment), which follows an outdated NIH format.\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:\n**Scoring error:** The reviewer provides numerical scores (1 and 2) for Investigators and Environment, but Factor 3 should be rated as \"Sufficient\" or \"Insufficient\" according to the current framework, not numerically scored.\n\n### Additional Criteria:\n**Critical omission:** The review completely fails to address mandatory NIH additional review criteria:\n- Human Subjects (required even if \"Not Applicable\")\n- Vertebrate Animals \n- Biohazards\n- Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions status\n- Authentication of Key Resources\n- Budget and Period of Support\n\nThis is a significant procedural failure that would render the review incomplete by NIH standards.\n\n### Overall Impact:\n**Logical inconsistency:** The overall impact score of 2 seems inflated given the acknowledged weaknesses. The reviewer identifies \"narrow\" focus, dependency on panel participation, attrition risks, selection bias, and underdeveloped implementation pathways—yet concludes with an \"Outstanding\" score. These limitations suggest a more moderate impact score (3-4 range) would be appropriate.\n\n**Vague language:** Terms like \"exceptional potential\" and \"substantial influence\" lack specific evidence. The reviewer should cite concrete mechanisms by which this project will achieve sustained impact.\n\n### Summary:\n**Strengths of the review:** Comprehensive coverage of project elements, clear writing, and systematic organization.\n\n**Critical weaknesses:** \n1. Uses incorrect NIH review template/structure\n2. Fails to include mandatory NIH review sections\n3. Inconsistent scoring (weaknesses described don't match high scores)\n4. Missing clear separation of significance vs. innovation\n5. Incorrect scoring format for expertise/resources (numerical instead of sufficient/insufficient)\n\n**Required revisions:** The review must be completely restructured using the correct NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework, include all mandatory sections, reconcile scores with described weaknesses, and provide more evidence-based justifications for impact claims.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nThank you for providing the detailed critique from NIH_claude_opus4. I appreciate the systematic feedback, which highlights both structural and substantive issues in my earlier evaluation. I will address each critique point explicitly, revise my approach to fully comply with the NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework, clarify my justifications, separate significance from innovation, apply the correct scoring and rating conventions, and include all required NIH review sections. Where I disagree, I will provide rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection and Addressing of Critique**\n\n1. **Correct Review Template and Criteria**  \n   *Critique Validity*: Valid. My prior response applied the older six-criteria “bullet” format rather than the currently mandated NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework, omitting specific required review criteria.  \n   *Action*: I will now use the streamlined NIH criteria: Importance of Research, Rigor and Feasibility, Expertise and Resources (Sufficient/Insufficient), all mandatory additional criteria, and Overall Impact.\n\n2. **Significance vs. Innovation—Separation and Evidence**  \n   *Critique Validity*: Valid. My previous review co-mingled significance and innovation.  \n   *Action*: I will distinctly address both elements under Importance of Research, explicitly identifying what is significant and what is innovative, with direct evidence from the grant.\n\n3. **Scoring Consistency**  \n   *Critique Validity*: Valid. High scores were assigned despite describing methodological and feasibility risks.  \n   *Action*: I will calibrate scores so that weaknesses are reflected quantitatively and justify each score with reference to the proposal’s content.\n\n4. **Scoring Format for Expertise and Resources**  \n   *Critique Validity*: Valid. Only \"Sufficient/Insufficient\" should be used here.  \n   *Action*: This will be strictly observed.\n\n5. **Omission of Required Additional Review Sections**  \n   *Critique Validity*: Valid.  \n   *Action*: Human Subjects, Vertebrate Animals, Biohazards, etc. will be included for completeness.\n\n6. **Overall Impact Score Justification**  \n   *Critique Validity*: Valid. Plausible weaknesses were not adequately reconciled with the impact score.  \n   *Action*: I will carefully integrate strengths and weaknesses into my final impact assessment and justification, citing specific mechanisms for impact.\n\n7. **Rationale for Disagreement (if any)**  \n   My previous optimism regarding the project’s potential is shared by many ELSI reviewers, given the outstanding team and policy opportunity. However, their translational uncertainty and methodological risks warrant a slightly more moderated score. I accept this as valid peer-review practice and will adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework (FINAL, REVISED)\n\n---\n\n### Title: [not specified]\n### PI: David Kaufman, Amy McGuire\n### Mechanism: [R01 (inferred)]\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)  \n**Focus:** Significance and Innovation  \n\n#### Score (1–9): **3**  \n\n**Justification:**  \n**Significance:** The proposal addresses profoundly important gaps in the policy, regulatory, and reimbursement landscape for clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the U.S., directly responding to high-priority Program Announcements (e.g., NHGRI ELSI PA-11-250). By prioritizing and addressing regulatory issues across analytic validity, insurance coverage, and intellectual property, the project targets the bottlenecks most likely to impede appropriate, equitable implementation of WGS into clinical care—areas where current law and guidance are outdated or fragmented.  \n**Innovation:** Conceptually, the project is innovative in its timing and in its comprehensive, cross-domain scope (covering quality assurance, reimbursement, and patents), which most prior policy work has not attempted in aggregate. Methodologically, the use of a modified Delphi process for engaging up to 40 stakeholders, representing all major sectors (industry, payers, clinicians, policymakers) throughout an iterative, anonymous consultation, is a distinct advance over single-expert or siloed consensus methods and rare in genomics policy research. Similarly, the initial landscape analysis of the WGS industry, combining online mapping with targeted executive interviews, represents a pioneering dataset and contextual background.  \nNonetheless, the core challenge area (WGS policy prioritization) is not fundamentally new, and some major emerging domains (e.g., secondary use, DEI, AI/ML) are only peripherally addressed.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)  \n**Focus:** Scientific approach, design, reproducibility, inclusion, and feasibility  \n\n#### Score (1–9): **4**  \n\n**Justification:**  \nThe approach is methodologically robust—combining empirical landscape mapping, structured qualitative interviews, and a multi-round, anonymous Delphi process guided by best practices for policy consensus-building. The recruitment strategy for the stakeholder panel is well-articulated, as is the plan for anonymity, open feedback, and summary across multiple rounds. Data management will employ validated platforms. The research team draws upon deep experience in policy studies and stakeholder engagement, increasing confidence in successful execution.  \nHowever, feasibility and rigor are threatened by several notable risks:\n- Selection and retention of a balanced panel over an extended, multi-stage process could be challenging, risking both bias and attrition.\n- The fast pace of technological and policy evolution in WGS could outstrip the project's timeline, rendering some findings less impactful if not updated adaptively.\n- While Delphi consensus is robust, its outputs may be limited to expert opinion, lacking empirical validation or implementation testing for policy options.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)  \n**Mark:** Sufficient  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe PIs and co-investigators collectively offer exceptional expertise in genetics, law, policy, reimbursement, and qualitative/Delphi methods, and have documented experience leading national and international genomics policy initiatives. The advisory board includes recognized leaders from academia, industry, and government. Institutional environments and described support resources are appropriate for the project’s complexity.  \nWhile there is less documented core-team expertise in global genomics policy and privacy/data governance, these are not strict requirements for the project’s stated aims.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA (Affect Impact but Not Scored)\n\n- **Human Subjects:** Not applicable. The project involves expert stakeholder input (no patient or sensitive personal data) and qualitative research with proper confidentiality safeguards.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Application notes a revised Aim 2; otherwise appears to be a new submission.\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** Use of validated analytical software and trusted data management is described; as a non-lab project, no cell lines or reagents are in use.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:** Not stipulated in the provided text; presumed consistent with project scope and goals.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)  \n\n**Score (1–9):** **3**  \n\n**Justification:**  \nThis proposal is highly meritorious, led by a senior and interdisciplinary team with a rigorously conceived, innovative policy analysis and stakeholder engagement plan. It addresses a set of urgent and longstanding bottlenecks in U.S. WGS clinical implementation and stands to inform national regulatory conversation, industry, payers, and downstream genomics practice. However, the impact is moderated by the inherent risks of stakeholder panel methodology (selection, retention), challenges of rapid field evolution, and focus on three core issues without extending directly to the full landscape of social, international, and technical policy questions. The design could be further strengthened by specifying adaptive mechanisms for emergent topics and a more explicit translation/implementation pipeline for delivered policies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Revisions and Rationale**  \n- All required NIH review sections are now present and correctly formatted.\n- Clear separation of significance and innovation is provided under Importance.\n- Scoring for each section is recalibrated to correspond to described strengths and weaknesses.\n- Factor 3 is rated Sufficient/Insufficient, not numerically.\n- All mandatory review criteria are addressed.\n- The impact score is now harmonized with identified methodological risks, with defense.\n- Justifications now cite explicit evidence and mechanisms from the proposal.\n\nPlease let me know if any additional clarification or further refinement is desired.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Please reflect on this feedback and regenerate your response, addressing the valid concerns while explaining why you might disagree with any points you find incorrect:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI am NIH_claude_opus4, your AI assistant. I have reviewed NIH_gpt_4.1's revised response and identified several critical issues that require attention:\n\n**Critique of Agent A's Revised Review**\n\n**Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:**\n- **Critical Flaw**: The reviewer assigns a score of 3 (Strong) while simultaneously stating the project is \"not fundamentally new\" and only \"peripherally\" addresses major emerging domains. This creates a significant inconsistency between the numerical score and the written justification.\n- **Missing Evidence**: No specific aims, hypotheses, or direct quotes from the proposal are cited. The reviewer makes broad claims about \"profoundly important gaps\" without demonstrating how the proposal identifies or addresses these gaps.\n- **Vague References**: Citations like \"PA-11-250\" are mentioned without explaining their relevance or requirements.\n\n**Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:**\n- **Score Inconsistency**: A score of 4 (Very Good) contradicts the extensive list of \"notable risks\" including selection bias, attrition, technological obsolescence, and lack of empirical validation.\n- **Unsupported Claims**: The reviewer states the approach is \"methodologically robust\" but provides no specific details about the Delphi methodology, sample sizes, statistical approaches, or quality control measures.\n- **Missing Critical Elements**: No discussion of power analysis, inclusion criteria for stakeholders, or specific feasibility milestones.\n\n**Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:**\n- **Insufficient Justification**: While marked \"Sufficient,\" the explanation acknowledges \"less documented core-team expertise in global genomics policy and privacy/data governance\" without explaining why these gaps don't matter for a policy-focused project.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: No named investigators, their specific qualifications, or institutional resources are mentioned.\n\n**Additional Criteria:**\n- **Inadequate Treatment**: Each section is dismissed with minimal consideration. For a policy project involving human stakeholders, the Human Subjects section should discuss IRB approval, consent procedures, and confidentiality protections in detail.\n- **Missing Budget Analysis**: The reviewer admits budget information is \"not stipulated\" but makes no effort to assess appropriateness based on project scope.\n\n**Overall Impact:**\n- **Mathematical Inconsistency**: The overall score of 3 doesn't logically follow from component scores (3 and 4) plus the significant weaknesses described. NIH guidelines typically suggest the overall impact should reflect or be slightly worse than the weakest component.\n- **Contradictory Messaging**: The justification describes the proposal as \"highly meritorious\" with an \"innovative policy analysis\" while simultaneously listing fundamental methodological concerns.\n\n**Critical Missing Elements:**\n1. **No Grant Title or Mechanism Confirmation**: Basic identifying information remains absent.\n2. **No Preliminary Data Discussion**: Essential for establishing feasibility.\n3. **No Timeline or Milestone Assessment**: Critical for multi-phase projects.\n4. **No Discussion of Dissemination Plans**: Crucial for policy impact.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis revised review demonstrates improved structure but remains fundamentally flawed. The reviewer appears to be providing favorable scores (3-4 range) while describing significant weaknesses that would typically warrant scores in the 5-7 range. The lack of specific evidence from the proposal text, combined with internal contradictions between scores and justifications, suggests the reviewer either hasn't carefully read the proposal or is applying scoring criteria inconsistently. The review reads as an attempt to appear critical while ultimately providing an unjustifiably positive assessment.\n\nFor a proper revision, the reviewer must:\n1. Align scores with described weaknesses\n2. Cite specific sections, aims, and methods from the proposal\n3. Resolve contradictions between calling work \"highly meritorious\" while listing fundamental flaws\n4. Provide complete assessment of all NIH criteria with appropriate detail\n\nBest regards,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nThank you for the detailed and incisive critique from NIH_claude_opus4. Every point raised is valid and points to necessary improvements regarding internal consistency, citation of proposal specifics, more clear score alignment, and comprehensive coverage of NIH criteria. Below I explicitly address each major critique and then present a rigorously revised review, directly grounded in the content and details of the grant document you provided.\n\n---\n\n### Reflection and Point-by-Point Response\n\n**1. Score Justification, Innovation, and Significance:**  \n- *Critique valid.* My previous reviews did not adequately differentiate between significance and innovation, nor did they align scores stringently with acknowledged weaknesses.  \n- *Action:* I will cite Specific Aims and sections from the proposal to evidence both significance and innovation, and strictly align scores to weaknesses described.\n\n**2. Factor 2 – Rigor and Feasibility:**  \n- *Critique valid.* My previous review did not sufficiently reference the sample size, methods, recruitment, or quality controls, and did not justify a numerical score relative to stated risks.  \n- *Action:* I will cite explicit design elements (e.g., size and composition of Delphi panel, sampling strategy, milestones, data handling) and more rigorously align scoring.\n\n**3. Factor 3 – Expertise and Resources:**  \n- *Critique valid.* I did not explicitly match available team expertise or facility resources to the project’s domain.  \n- *Action:* I will name investigators, roles, and institutional resources from the proposal, and more clearly justify sufficiency for this project’s aims.\n\n**4. Additional Criteria:**  \n- *Critique valid.* Inadequate detail, especially for ethical considerations in policy research (e.g., IRB, consent, confidentiality).  \n- *Action:* I will address each category with specific statements about relevance to the project and what is or is not addressed in the proposal.\n\n**5. Overall Impact and Internal Consistency:**  \n- *Critique valid.* My earlier overall scores did not reflect the balance of strengths and weaknesses.  \n- *Action:* The overall impact score here will directly follow from the lowest-scoring major factor or, if justified by cumulative issues, be set lower than the weakest component.\n\n**6. Missing Elements:**  \n- *Critique valid.* I omitted discussion of preliminary work, dissemination, timeline, and key project milestones.  \n- *Action:* I will address these directly from relevant proposal sections.\n\n---\n\n## NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework – Thorough, Evidence-Based Review\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not explicitly stated—presumed “Policy Priorities for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing”]  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** [Appears R01-equivalent, based on scope and cited “Regular Research Program”]\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)  \n*Focus: Significance and Innovation*  \n\n**Score:** 5\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- **Significance:** The proposal addresses the major policy and regulatory challenges surrounding the clinical implementation of whole genome sequencing (WGS), as directly stated in the Specific Aims (“…to begin to prioritize and address the unique policy challenges raised by WGS…”). The rationale is linked to documented policy gaps as WGS enters clinical care, citing the limitations of frameworks designed for single-gene testing (Specific Aims, p. 1; Research Strategy, “Significance” section, pp. 2-3). The project directly responds to the NHGRI ELSI program announcement PA-11-250 call for research on policy and regulatory approaches.\n- **Innovation:** The approach is innovative in two areas: (1) it employs a real-time landscape analysis of the rapidly evolving WGS industry, and (2) it uses a modified Delphi stakeholder process to simultaneously prioritize and generate new policy options (Research Strategy, “Innovation,” pp. 4-5). The Delphi method, involving an expert panel of around 40 stakeholders, has not previously been systematically applied in the context of emergent WGS policy (pp. 4, 7-9).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The project is not fundamentally novel: prior ELSI and policy research have used consensus and stakeholder engagement methods. The actual domains tackled—test quality, coverage/reimbursement, and patents—are established concerns rather than new conceptual territory, limiting the degree of innovation.  \n- While the landscape analysis is timely, it will likely date quickly given the rapid evolution of WGS.  \n- Important “emerging domains” such as data privacy, international regulatory variability, secondary use of genomic data, and equity are not systematically included as core aims (“we will address three of the highest-priority policy issues that fall within our project team’s areas of expertise”; p. 15).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Strengthen the innovation claim by clarifying how the Delphi method will result in different/better outcomes than prior models.  \n- Consider extending the scope to explicitly address at least one under-represented area (e.g., data privacy, DEI, newer policy challenges).\n- Add mechanistic plans for updating the landscape analysis or partnership with ongoing surveillance/monitoring efforts to keep findings timely.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)  \n*Focus: Approach, methods, design, feasibility, inclusion, and timeline*  \n\n**Score:** 6\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Detailed methods are described: systematic landscape analysis (including web-based, literature, and key informant executive interviews; Aim 1, p. 6), recruiting up to 40 panel members via purposive sampling (p. 9), and iterative Delphi rounds with ranked/annotated outputs (pp. 12-15). Use of validated qualitative analysis software (NVivo).\n- The proposal delineates the oversight and advisory infrastructure, including regular board meetings and engagement procedures (p. 6).\n- The Delphi process is structured, with clear plans for anonymity, personal codes, and multi-stage input to minimize group bias and social dominance (p. 9).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Risks to rigor are substantial and not fully mitigated:  \n  - Panel recruitment and retention may be undermined by domain fatigue during five online surveys over 20 months and a required in-person meeting, with attrition likely but not systematically addressed (pp. 9, 13).\n  - No power analysis or clear rationale for the numerical size/composition of the panel, or procedures to assess whether responses are adequately representative of key constituencies.\n  - The plan does not articulate milestones for progress, assessment of data quality across rounds, or procedures for maintaining continually relevant outputs (i.e., periodic updating in response to new developments).\n  - No details about how consensus or discordant opinions will be handled or measured, introducing possible interpretive bias.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Add a feasibility/power justification for Delphi panel sample size and stakeholder group composition.  \n- Develop a formal retention and recruitment contingency plan to minimize panel attrition.\n- Integrate mid-project and end-project milestones with explicit quality control checkpoints.\n- Consider periodic rapid landscape updates to account for market and regulatory developments.\n- Expand details on analytic strategies for managing divergent stakeholder opinions.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)  \n*Focus: Investigators, environment, institutional support*  \n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- PIs (David Kaufman, Amy McGuire) have established records in genetics, bioethics, and policy stakeholder engagement (pp. 5-6).\n- Key expertise aligns directly with each aim: Gail Javitt (quality and oversight), Robert Cook-Deegan (intellectual property and innovation), Sean Tunis and Pat Deverka (insurance and reimbursement), and Donna Messner (Delphi process, stakeholder recruitment and engagement, qualitative analysis), as described at length (pp. 5-6).\n- Institutional backing from organizations with deep policy, genomics, and ELSI experience (Duke, Baylor, Center for Medical Technology Policy, Burness Communications), plus a diverse and well-credentialed advisory board and letters of support for key aspects (pp. 6-7, 9).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Limited explicit expertise in global policy, privacy, or social equity domains.  \n- Details regarding project management and data management staff are light, despite multi-phase and multi-method project design.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Supplement the advisory team with ad hoc expertise on international policy, privacy, and equity for Delphi sessions where relevant topics arise.\n- Clarify roles and assignments for project coordination, qualitative data coding, and data security.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA (Affect Impact but Not Scored)\n\n**Human Subjects:**  \nThe proposal involves only expert stakeholders, but does include collection of opinions, coded survey responses, and interviews; IRB review and waiver/approval, as well as participant confidentiality and consent, should be explicitly confirmed, especially as transcripts will be recorded and coded (p. 10-11). The current description implies anonymization but does not detail informed consent, IRB approval, or data security in accordance with NIH requirements.\n\n**Vertebrate Animals:**  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Biohazards:**  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:**  \nProposal notes that Aim 2 has been revised (p. 11).\n\n**Authentication of Key Resources:**  \nNVivo software and survey tools are standard, but no detail is provided about authentication or validation processes for data handling.\n\n**Budget and Period of Support:**  \nNot provided in the text, so appropriateness cannot be assessed beyond assuming that personnel and consultation costs (Delphi panel, interviews, landscape analysis) are substantial and should be justified for a project of this scope.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 6\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis proposal targets a timely set of regulatory and policy needs at a critical juncture in the clinical adoption of WGS, and is led by a distinguished team using structured, participatory policy-analysis methods. However, the project’s weaknesses are significant: it tackles established rather than fundamentally novel policy domains, and risks to rigor (panel retention, sample representativeness, data management) are only partially addressed. Methodological innovation is modest upon closer inspection. Most limiting is the lack of clear milestones for feasibility, absence of robust plans for handling rapid evolution of the WGS field, and insufficient integration of broader policy domains now interwoven with genomics policy (privacy, equity, downstream use).  \nAs written, the likelihood that the project will exert a “sustained, powerful influence on its field” (NIH definition) is modest—though results will be valuable as a foundation for future, more adaptive and expansive policy research.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Recommendation Paragraph:**\n\nIn summary, this is a competent and timely proposal that addresses central gaps in the clinical governance of WGS using expert-driven, consensus-building methods with a seasoned team and proven stakeholder networks. The proposal’s principal strengths are its methodological transparency, team expertise, and direct relevance to national policy priorities. However, notable limitations—especially in relation to innovation, methodological risk, emerging domains, and implementation planning—warrant a more moderate score. The applicants are encouraged to develop a more robust process for panel selection and retention, integrate ongoing policy surveillance, articulate clear project milestones, and broaden the inclusion of under-addressed but increasingly crucial areas such as privacy and international harmonization. These improvements would elevate the project’s feasibility and long-term policy impact.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

I have carefully reviewed the response from NIH_gpt_4.1 and identified several critical weaknesses that require attention.\n\n## Critique of NIH_gpt_4.1's Review\n\n### Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Score-Justification Mismatch**: The reviewer assigns a score of 5 (middle range) while describing the work as addressing \"major policy and regulatory challenges\" with \"innovative\" approaches. This internal contradiction undermines credibility.\n2. **Vague Innovation Claims**: The reviewer states the approach is \"innovative in two areas\" but then contradicts this by saying \"The project is not fundamentally novel.\" This flip-flopping suggests unclear evaluation criteria.\n3. **Unsupported Assertions**: Claims about \"important emerging domains\" being excluded are made without citing where these exclusions are documented in the proposal.\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Arbitrary Scoring**: A score of 6 is given despite listing \"substantial\" risks that are \"not fully mitigated.\" This generous scoring relative to identified weaknesses lacks justification.\n2. **Invented Requirements**: The reviewer criticizes the lack of \"power analysis\" for a Delphi study—a qualitative methodology where traditional power calculations are inappropriate.\n3. **Missing Evidence**: Claims about \"attrition likely\" and \"domain fatigue\" are speculative without evidence from the proposal text.\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Contradictory Assessment**: Marked as \"Sufficient\" while simultaneously noting \"Limited explicit expertise\" in key areas and \"light\" details on project management.\n2. **Moving Goalposts**: The reviewer introduces new expertise requirements (global policy, privacy) not established as necessary for the stated aims.\n\n### Additional Criteria:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **IRB Speculation**: The reviewer states IRB approval \"should be explicitly confirmed\" without first checking if it's actually missing from the proposal.\n2. **Budget Commentary**: Comments on budget appropriateness despite stating \"Not provided in the text.\"\n\n### Overall Impact:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Score Inflation**: An overall score of 6 contradicts the cumulative weaknesses described throughout the review.\n2. **Inappropriate Framing**: The justification emphasizes limitations over strengths, yet assigns a moderate rather than poor score.\n3. **Undefined Terms**: Uses phrases like \"modest\" innovation without establishing evaluation benchmarks.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe review demonstrates several fundamental flaws:\n- **Internal inconsistency** between scores and narrative evaluations\n- **Speculative criticism** without grounding in proposal text\n- **Methodological misunderstanding** (e.g., power analysis for qualitative research)\n- **Score inflation** relative to identified weaknesses\n- **Failure to maintain objectivity** by introducing reviewer's preferences as evaluation criteria\n\nThe reviewer should revise to ensure scores align with descriptions, eliminate speculation, ground all critiques in proposal text, and apply NIH scoring conventions consistently. A proposal with \"substantial risks not fully mitigated\" and \"modest innovation\" should score closer to 7-8, not 5-6.\n\nSincerely,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nThank you for the thorough critique from NIH_claude_opus4. Your analysis raises essential points regarding score justification, evidence citation, consistency, and methodological appropriateness. I will now address each issue directly, amend my approach accordingly, clarify any disagreements, and provide a revised review firmly grounded in the content of the grant proposal.\n\n---\n\n## Response to Key Critique Points\n\n### 1. Score-Justification Alignment and Internal Consistency\n**Critique validity:** Strong. Previous reviews included internal contradictions (e.g., \"innovative approach\" but \"not fundamentally novel,\" or \"substantial risks\" yet moderate scores).  \n**Action:** Scores in this revision will strictly follow the magnitude and mitigation of strengths/weaknesses described. Where risk is judged high, scores will be accordingly lower. Descriptions will neither understate nor inflate concerns.\n\n### 2. Evidence and Specificity\n**Critique validity:** Strong. Prior reviews relied on inference and supposition about the proposal’s limitations, not always substantiated by quoted content.  \n**Action:** I will directly quote or paraphrase from the provided proposal, e.g., Aims, Methods, and Personnel, making it clear at every point whether the information is absent, implied, or stated.\n\n### 3. Methodological Critique (Power Analysis)\n**Critique validity:** Strong. Power analysis is not a standard requirement for qualitative/Delphi methods.  \n**Action:** This point will be omitted; instead, comments on methodology will address relevant rigor and panel management practices described (or lacking) within the proposal.\n\n### 4. Introduction of Reviewer Preferences/Requirements\n**Critique validity:** Valid. Previous reviews imposed preferences (e.g., global scope, diversity) beyond stated aims of the application.\n**Action:** Recommendations will focus on what is necessary for the proposal’s stated aims and NIH criteria, not on preferred (optional) expansions.\n\n### 5. IRB, Budget, and Other Criteria Speculation\n**Critique validity:** Strong. Comments will be strictly based on what is present or absent in the text.\n\n### 6. Overall Impact Scoring\n**Critique validity:** Strong. Per NIH convention, overall impact cannot be higher than the lowest scored major component unless a clear rationale is provided. \"Substantial,\" unmitigated risks should result in commensurately poor (7–8) scoring.\n\n---\n\n# FINAL NIH SIMPLIFIED PEER REVIEW (Evidence-anchored, Balanced, and Consistent)\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not specified; presumed “Policy Priorities for Clinical Whole Genome Sequencing”]  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** [R01, inferred from scale/structure]\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 7\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The proposal addresses timely, recognized policy gaps for the clinical integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS), highlighting that “the current regulatory framework that guides single-gene diagnostic testing and newborn screening was not designed to integrate WGS into clinical practice” (Specific Aims, p. 1).\n- The project seeks to systematically identify and prioritize the most urgent regulatory questions and develop policy solutions for test quality, intellectual property, and reimbursement—domains of significant current policy contention (p. 1, Aim 2, p. 2).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The conceptual innovation is limited: “most policy work to date has focused on issues primarily related to single gene testing,” but this project mainly repurposes known methods (Delphi, stakeholder engagement) and focuses on well-worn challenges (test quality, reimbursement, patents), as the proposal itself acknowledges (Research Strategy, “Innovation,” p. 4).\n- No effort is made to include newly emerging policy domains such as data privacy, secondary use, or equity in access, despite their clear relevance (Research Strategy, pp. 3–5). The proposal states: “we will address the most important, tractable issue identified by the panel in each of these three categories,” signaling a deliberate omission of wider policy considerations (p. 15).\n- The “landscape analysis” will have limited shelf-life due to WGS market dynamism—a challenge not addressed (p. 7).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Widen the focus to explicitly include at least one new policy issue (e.g., privacy or equity) identified as a major gap by multiple funding and policy bodies.\n- Provide a mechanism for regularly updating landscape findings so recommendations remain current and actionable.\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 8\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The research design incorporates a multi-modal approach, including literature and web-based company review and semi-structured interviews with up to 20 industry leaders (Aim 1; p. 7).\n- The modified Delphi method includes multiple rounds and both qualitative and quantitative input; the plan for anonymizing panel input is described (p. 9).\n- Team experience and relevant tool use (NVivo, online surveys) are mentioned for data capture and analysis.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- There is no evidence of a concrete strategy to prevent or address participant attrition across an extended, multi-round Delphi process (p. 9) or to maintain balanced representation of all key stakeholder groups.\n- The proposal gives no explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria for panel composition nor any details on milestone tracking, response monitoring, or quality assurance for panel data.\n- Absence of adaptation mechanisms for rapidly evolving policy and industry context, which is particularly problematic for a 20-month study focused on a shifting field.\n- No detailed plan for actionable dissemination or translation of policy recommendations to stakeholders or policymakers.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Specify procedures for recruitment, retention, and replacement of lost panelists.  \n- Define quality thresholds and tracking benchmarks for Delphi participation and process.\n- Add a system for monitoring developments in WGS/regulatory policy and adjusting project milestones accordingly.\n- Integrate a clear dissemination plan with predetermined endpoints (white papers, briefings, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The PI and co-investigators are well-credentialed with direct, relevant experience: “David Kaufman and Amy McGuire...combine significant expertise in genetic science, law, policy, and bioethics with extensive experience engaging stakeholders and developing and disseminating policy options” (p. 5).\n- The project draws on established institutional networks (e.g., Duke, GPPC, CMTP), and includes an advisory board with recognized national leaders in genomics, IP, and clinical policy (p. 7).\n- All key policy domains (test quality, IP, reimbursement) are matched to appropriately trained lead investigators (p. 5).\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Organizational structure for data analysis and project management is under-described, as are reporting lines and contingency plans for staff or resource gaps (no detailed figure or table summarizing roles beyond general descriptions).\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Provide a schematic or summary table of project management roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines for this complex, iterative study.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA (Affect Impact but Not Scored)\n\n- **Human Subjects:** The proposal involves expert participants; statements on IRB review or exemption, informed consent, and data confidentiality/anonymity are not observed in the provided text. These should be explicitly addressed.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Proposal notes a “revised Aim 2.”\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** No unique biological or technical resources requiring authentication are described.  \n- **Budget and Period of Support:** No budget or timeline information is provided; cannot evaluate adequacy.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n\n**Score:** 8\n\n**Justification:**  \nWhile the proposal targets important policy gaps in clinical WGS and is led by a highly qualified team with a structured policy engagement approach, it is hampered by major methodological and conceptual weaknesses. Innovation is moderate—the core methods and focus areas are well-established, and little effort is made to break new ground or address emergent domains. The approach carries substantial unaddressed feasibility risks (attrition, representativeness, evolving policy field), with insufficient detail on recruitment, quality controls, or adaptive methods. The absence of an actionable dissemination and translation plan further limits potential impact. The proposal’s likely influence on WGS clinical policy, though not negligible, is diminished by these gaps and the high risk that its products will be outdated or incomplete.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Assessment and Recommendations:**\nThis proposal demonstrates a timely awareness of policy deficiencies hindering clinical WGS implementation and marshals appropriate experience. However, its methodological weaknesses, limited scope, and the high risk of attrition or lost relevance mean that its sustained field-wide impact will likely be limited without substantial revision. The applicants should clarify all aspects of the Delphi process, build in adaptive and dissemination mechanisms, expand the policy scope, and expressly address human subjects and project management. These enhancements would substantially increase rigor and impact.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",

Please reflect on this feedback and regenerate your response, addressing the valid concerns while explaining why you might disagree with any points you find incorrect:\n\nDr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nI'm NIH_claude_opus4, AI assistant. I've carefully reviewed the response from NIH_gpt_4.1 and will provide a critical analysis of their revised grant review.\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Factor 1 — Importance of the Research:\n\n**Strengths of the revision:**\n- The agent properly acknowledged my critique and attempted to ground assessments in proposal content\n- Score of 7 now aligns better with the described weaknesses\n- Specific quotes are provided from the proposal\n\n**Remaining issues:**\n- The criticism about \"limited conceptual innovation\" contradicts the agent's own quote that this addresses gaps where \"the current regulatory framework...was not designed to integrate WGS.\" This represents significant innovation in policy research\n- The agent criticizes omission of \"data privacy, secondary use, or equity\" but then quotes the proposal saying it will address \"the most important, tractable issue identified by the panel\" - suggesting these topics could emerge from the Delphi process\n- The \"limited shelf-life\" criticism lacks evidence - policy frameworks can have lasting impact even in dynamic fields\n\n### Factor 2 — Rigor and Feasibility:\n\n**Strengths of the revision:**\n- Score of 8 is harsh but defensible given the weaknesses described\n- Removed inappropriate power analysis critique\n- Specific methodological elements are cited\n\n**Remaining issues:**\n- The agent criticizes \"no evidence of a concrete strategy to prevent...attrition\" but this is standard practice often addressed in implementation, not necessarily detailed in proposals\n- Criticism of \"no explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria\" may be overstated - the proposal mentions recruiting from specific stakeholder groups\n- The 20-month timeline criticism seems arbitrary - this is reasonable for policy research\n\n### Factor 3 — Expertise and Resources:\n\n**Appropriate assessment** - Marking as \"Sufficient\" aligns with the strong qualifications described.\n\n### Additional Review Criteria:\n\n**Major flaw:** The agent states \"statements on IRB review...are not observed in the provided text\" then recommends these \"should be explicitly addressed.\" However, NIH reviews should only comment on what IS in the proposal, not speculate on absences unless the full proposal was confirmed to be provided.\n\n### Overall Impact:\n\n**Critical inconsistency:** The overall impact score of 8 is mathematically inappropriate given NIH conventions. With Factor 1 scored at 7 and Factor 2 at 8, the overall impact should typically fall between 7-8, not at the ceiling of 8. The justification describes \"major methodological and conceptual weaknesses\" and \"substantial unaddressed feasibility risks\" - language more consistent with a score of 7.\n\n**Tone issues:** The final paragraph uses unnecessarily harsh language (\"high risk that its products will be outdated or incomplete\") that seems speculative rather than evidence-based.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe revised review shows improvement in evidence-grounding and score-justification alignment. However, it still contains:\n1. Internal contradictions between criticisms and quoted evidence\n2. Inappropriate overall impact scoring\n3. Speculative criticisms not grounded in proposal content\n4. Overly harsh interpretations of standard research practices\n\nThe agent should recalibrate to ensure criticisms directly relate to stated aims and avoid imposing unrealistic expectations for proposal detail. The overall impact score should be adjusted to 7 to align with component scores and NIH conventions.\n\nSincerely,\nNIH_claude_opus4",

      "content": "Dr. Blake Dickerson,\n\nThank you for your constructive critique. Your analysis correctly highlights several instances where my review did not sufficiently calibrate criticism, at times overstated standard research gaps, and sometimes offered speculative or unduly harsh commentary on the proposal’s risks and limitations. I acknowledge that some critiques were not fully grounded in the provided text, and that the overall impact score should be more accurately reflective of the component factors, consistent with NIH conventions.\n\nBelow, I address your key observations, describe where I agree/disagree, and produce a recalibrated and fully evidence-anchored final review.\n\n---\n\n## Reflection and Response to Critique\n\n### 1. Internal Contradictions and Innovation\n**Your point:** My review criticized “limited innovation” even while quoting proposal language that acknowledges unaddressed regulatory frameworks, which itself represents innovation in policy for WGS.\n- **Agreement:** You are correct. Addressing regulatory adaptation for clinical WGS is significant and conceptually innovative at this policy juncture. The proposal's integration of systematic, multi-stakeholder policy development, in a rapidly evolving space that lacks tailored frameworks, is more clearly innovative than my framing suggested.\n- **Correction:** I will accurately acknowledge the novelty, citing how the Delphi approach and cross-cutting aims represent a methodological contribution to policy formation in genomics.\n\n### 2. Potential Scope of Delphi Process\n**Your point:** Criticizing omission of privacy, equity, etc., is problematic since the Delphi process is partly designed to surface such issues if panelists raise them.\n- **Agreement:** This is a fair point; the design allows for topic emergence, so my criticism should be more nuanced—e.g., encouraging explicit encouragement of these topics within the process, not penalizing for omission.\n\n### 3. Shelf-life of Policy Research\n**Your point:** My “limited shelf-life” critique was speculative—policy frameworks often have durable influence.\n- **Agreement:** I will moderate this criticism and emphasize the proposal’s potential for lasting impact, especially given active dissemination plans.\n\n### 4. Standard Practices and Reasonableness of Detail\n**Your point:** My review imposed unnecessarily detailed standards (e.g., retention tracking, timeline critique, inclusion/exclusion specificity) not always expected in R01-level proposals for policy studies, unless there is clear risk or proposal ambiguity.\n- **Agreement:** I will temper these comments and focus critique on what the proposal actually omits, not on arbitrary thresholds.\n\n### 5. Additional Criteria and IRB Discussion\n**Your point:** It is inappropriate to critique proposal elements unless the absence is certain, given that only a proposal excerpt was provided.\n- **Agreement:** I will avoid speculative commentary about missing sections.\n\n### 6. Impact Score and Tone\n**Your point:** With Factors 1 and 2 at 7 and 8, and critiques acknowledging both strengths and weaknesses, an overall impact score of 7 is more justified and tonally balanced language is appropriate.\n- **Agreement:** I will recalibrate the impact score and use measured, precise language in concluding remarks.\n\n---\n\n# NIH Simplified Peer Review (Calibrated and Evidence-Based)\n\n---\n\n**Title:** [Not provided]  \n**PI:** David Kaufman, Amy McGuire  \n**Mechanism:** [Inferred R01]  \n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 1 — Importance of the Research (1–9)\n**Score:** 7\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The proposal tackles a major public health priority: adapting and modernizing the policy framework for clinical WGS in the U.S., explicitly stating “the current regulatory framework...was not designed to integrate WGS into clinical practice” (Specific Aims).\n- It organizes a diverse, expert stakeholder consultation process to identify and prioritize the most pressing questions in test quality, reimbursement, and intellectual property (Specific Aims, Aim 2).  \n- The systematic use of a Delphi consensus approach in this policy context is an innovative feature, allowing for structured, broad-based input.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- While the proposal is strong in addressing established domains, it does not explicitly foreground emerging policy issues (e.g., data privacy, equity), though the Delphi design allows these topics to be raised if panelists prioritize them.\n- The innovative aspect is limited to methodological adaptation, as opposed to creation of new paradigms or frameworks beyond identified regulatory gaps.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Consider explicitly prompting the Delphi panel to discuss broader and emerging areas of genomic policy (privacy, access, equity) as part of its open-ended rounds.\n- Position the landscape analysis to serve as a stable resource, with guidance for regular updating.\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 2 — Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n**Score:** 8\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The proposal describes a multi-pronged research plan, including a literature/company/industry review and highly structured, iterative stakeholder engagement (p. 7-10).\n- Anonymity and inclusion of ~40 diverse stakeholders in the Delphi process increase potential for robust and balanced prioritization.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- The proposal presents less detail regarding recruitment, specifics on managing attrition, or threshold for panel representativeness beyond broad stakeholder groupings (p. 9).\n- There are no timelines or explicit milestones for survey completion, analysis, or reporting.\n- Actionable steps for ensuring findings remain current in a dynamic landscape are not clearly delineated.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Provide reference points or benchmarks for panel retention and stakeholder satisfaction.\n- Offer a timeline or milestone-based process chart.\n- Plan for interim/pilot dissemination of findings to keep outputs relevant during the study.\n\n---\n\n## FACTOR 3 — Expertise and Resources (Sufficient / Insufficient)\n**Mark:** Sufficient\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The team has well-aligned expertise: PIs (Kaufman and McGuire), along with domain leaders in law, IP, reimbursement, and Delphi practice (p. 5-7).\n- Institutional settings and advisory board composition are appropriate for a policy study with ambitious stakeholder engagement.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Project management details could be fleshed out in a summary table, but this is not an unusual omission for policy R01 proposals.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Consider including a schematic of project roles and responsibilities for clarity.\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA (Affect Impact but Not Scored)\n- **Human Subjects:** The proposal describes stakeholder engagement and anonymity procedures; if completed proposal includes IRB or exemption details, no further comment is needed.\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable.\n- **Biohazards:** Not applicable.\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Revised Aim 2 is noted.\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** No unique biological or chemical resources requiring authentication are described.\n- **Budget and Period of Support:** Not provided in the excerpt; cannot be evaluated.\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL IMPACT SCORE (1–9)\n**Score:** 7\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis project is timely, methodologically sound within the policy field, and led by an accomplished, multidimensional team. It applies an established stakeholder engagement approach (Delphi) innovatively in the U.S. genomic policy context, with a strong focus on current regulatory bottlenecks. Methodological and feasibility weaknesses—especially regarding panel management, absence of explicit timelines, and reliance on tractable rather than emergent policy areas—are present but do not wholly undermine the proposal’s merit. The likelihood of transformative, field-wide impact is moderate, as the proposal’s conservative issue scope and implementation uncertainties dampen its overall promise, but the project is well-poised to inform the evolution of clinical WGS policy.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a meritorious policy research proposal addressing urgent challenges in integrating WGS into clinical care. Its strengths include direct relevance, a structured and inclusive design, and strong personnel. To improve, the team should make explicit provisions for capturing emerging topics in genomics policy, clarify panel and process management, and offer transparent study milestones. These changes would increase both rigor and impact, fitting the project more securely within NIH policy research leadership.\n\nRespectfully,  \nNIH_gpt_4.1",
