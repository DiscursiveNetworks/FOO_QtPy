Data Acquisition and QC  \n   • Gather transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and clinical data.  \n   • Perform basic quality checks and normalization (e.g., filtering genes, handling missing metabolite data, median-normalizing proteomics signals).\n\n2. Cross-Species Harmonization  \n   • Use Ensembl BioMart to map one-to-one gene orthologs between Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis.  \n   • Exclude any genes without direct one-to-one orthologs or with complex mappings.\n\n3. Multi-Omic Integration  \n   • Integrate transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and clinical information.  \n   • Apply multivariate methods (DIABLO or pairwise PLS) to identify key signals that distinguish susceptible vs resilient host responses.\n\n4. Pathway and Phase-Stratified Interpretation  \n   • Examine functional pathways (e.g., KEGG, Reactome) and identify influences of different infection phases.  \n   • Correlate identified modules with parasitemia and hematological measures.\n\n5. Visualization and Reporting  \n   • Produce QC plots, differential expression plots (volcano, PCA), heatmaps, and network diagrams.  \n   • Provide a thorough written report, metadata files, and reproducible code/scripts.",

      "content": "Dr. Juan B. Gutiérrez, below is a consolidated list of the data sources (with links) you will need for Stage 1 (Data Acquisition and QC). These include transcripts (RNA-Seq), metabolomics, proteomics (SOMAScan), and clinical files for Experiments 06 and 07, plus a brief description of each.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nEXPERIMENT 06 (E06 – Macaca mulatta)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1) Clinical Data  \n   • URL: http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/MaHPIC/Experiment_06/  \n   • Description: Contains CSV, XLS, or TSV files for parasitemia (microscopy, PCR), hematology, reticulocyte counts, and other clinical/telemetry measurements collected daily or other specific time intervals during infection.\n\n2) Transcriptomics (GSE127079)  \n   • GEO Accession: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127079  \n   • Description: RNA-Seq data of E06 (whole blood and/or bone marrow) at multiple timepoints post-inoculation. Includes raw count data, metadata, and protocols.\n\n3) Metabolomics (MTBLS824)  \n   • MetaboLights Accession: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS824  \n   • Description: Untargeted metabolomics data gathered from plasma and cellular fractions. Contains peak tables, sample metadata, and experimental details.\n\n4) Proteomics (SOMAScan)  \n   • URL: http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/MaHPIC/Experiment_06/E06TargetedProteomics-Feb2019/  \n   • Description: Targeted proteomic quantifications generated via SOMAScan assays. Provides normalized intensities (or raw intensities plus metadata).\n\n5) Telemetry (Optional)  \n   • URL: Same directory as E06 Clinical Data above.  \n   • Description: May include continuous remote measurements for body temperature, heart rate, activity, etc. Not strictly required unless you plan time-series correlations with physiologic measures.\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nEXPERIMENT 07 (E07 – Macaca fascicularis, with one M. mulatta control)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1) Clinical Data (E07A)  \n   • URL: http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/MaHPIC/Experiment_07/E07AMalariaCore/  \n   • Description: Data from a failed inoculation trial. Generally treated as exploratory; use if you wish to evaluate baseline or out-of-range behaviors.\n\n2) Clinical Data (E07B)  \n   • URL: http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/MaHPIC/Experiment_07/E07BMalariaCore/  \n   • Description: Main clinical dataset for E07B, which successfully infected Macaca fascicularis (and included a M. mulatta control). Contains parasitemia, hematology, reticulocytes, etc.\n\n3) Transcriptomics (GSE128115)  \n   • GEO Accession: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE128115  \n   • Description: RNA-Seq data (whole blood and/or bone marrow) for E07. Similar structure to GSE127079, with raw counts and metadata across six timepoints.\n\n4) Metabolomics (MTBLS822)  \n   • MetaboLights Accession: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS822  \n   • Description: Metabolomics data for E07, using similar methodology as E06. Includes peak listings, QC, and associated sample metadata.\n\n5) Proteomics (SOMAScan)  \n   • URL: http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/MaHPIC/Experiment_07/E07TargetedProteomics-Feb2019/  \n   • Description: SOMAScan-based proteomic quantifications for E07. Check presence of readme files for sample naming schemes, normalization details, etc.\n\n6) Telemetry (Optional)  \n   • URL: Same directory (E07) as the clinical data.  \n   • Description: Continuous measures of physiology similar to E06, used for time-series correlation with infection phases or daily averages.\n\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nHOW TO USE THESE RESOURCES\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n• Clinical directories (for E06, E07A, E07B) are hosted at http://plasmodb.org under “MaHPIC” and typically include spreadsheets with daily parasitemia counts, reticulocyte measurements, and CBC data.  \n• GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) links (GSE127079, GSE128115) provide transcript levels, often in raw count format (e.g., FASTQ, processed read counts) plus sample annotations.  \n• MetaboLights accessions contain metabolomics raw data, peak tables, and study design files.  \n• Proteomics (SOMAScan) directories house spreadsheets or TSV files with protein abundance levels.  \n• Telemetry is optional; you only need these data if you want to incorporate physiological time-series correlates.\n\nBy obtaining these files, you will have the complete multi-omic and clinical scope needed for Stage 1 of the pipeline (Data Acquisition and QC). Let me know if you need more details on how to organize or process these datasets.",
