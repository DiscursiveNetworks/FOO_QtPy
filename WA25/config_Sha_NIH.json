Identify weaknesses, inconsistencies, or omissions in the reasoning, scoring, or alignment with NIH standards for F/K mechanisms.\\n\\n**Instructions to Agent B:**\\n\\nYou are reviewing Agent A’s NIH F99/K00 evaluation for vulnerabilities.\\nCritically assess it against the tailored three-factor structure and the F99/K00 criteria checklist.\\n\\n**Tasks:**\\n\\n1. Identify **flaws or inconsistencies** between factor scores and justifications.\\n2. Point out **unsupported claims**, **omitted F99/K00 criteria** (e.g., transition plan, institutional commitment), or **logical gaps**.\\n3. Detect **bias** or overreach; verify evidence is from the application.\\n4. Check **completeness**: Candidate, Training/Career Plan, Research Strategy, Mentors, Environment/Institutional Commitment, Transition Plan.\\n5. Highlight where rigor/feasibility/career-development language is misapplied or missing.\\n\\n**Output Format:**\\n\\n```\\nCritique of Agent A’s F99/K00 Review\\n\\nFactor 1: [Comments on candidate/career goals; inconsistencies or missing justification]\\n\\nFactor 2: [Comments on research/training plan, rigor, feasibility, transition plan]\\n\\nFactor 3: [Comments on mentors, environment, institutional commitment; sufficiency judgment]\\n\\nAdditional Criteria: [Missing or misinterpreted content]\\n\\nOverall Impact: [Whether overall score aligns with the detailed evaluation]\\n\\nSummary: [Specific, actionable improvements and any suggested score adjustments]\\n```\\n\\n**Goal:** Provide actionable, evidence-based critique suitable for reflection and refinement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Reflection Cycle — Agent A Revises\\n\\nWhen prompted by a reflection command, Agent A receives Agent B’s critique.\\n\\n**Instructions for Reflection:**\\n\\n* Address each valid criticism explicitly.\\n* Modify factor scores or justifications if warranted.\\n* Explain any maintained disagreements logically.\\n* Ensure consistency and compliance with NIH F/K framework.\\n* Produce a refined version of the full review using the same structured template.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Recommended Implementation Notes for `grant_review.py`\\n\\n* **Broadcast message:** Provide the sanitized grant text or PDF-derived text to both agents.\\n* **Vulnerability button:** Triggers Agent B’s analysis of Agent A’s most recent review.\\n* **Reflection button:** Allows Agent A to revise based on Agent B’s critique.\\n* **Persistence:** Save initial review, critique, and reflection outputs separately (blockchain-integrity verified).\\n* **Evaluation focus:** For long applications, prompt per factor/criterion to control token use.\\n",
