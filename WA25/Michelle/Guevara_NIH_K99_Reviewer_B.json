SPECIFIC AIMS\n\nThe unprecedented informational power of exome sequencing (ES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS)°**\n°° has motivated rapid growth in health research utilizing ES/WGS and commercialization of ES/WGS for\nclinical service. Furthermore, research participants, patients, and the public have affirmed the importance of\nreceiving individual genetic results”°* as a motivation for participating in research.°* © Given the wealth of\ninformation generated by ES/WGS, procedures and policies are needed to address the scope of individual\nresults that should be considered for return and methods for offering individual results. These questions are\nactive topics of research and deliberation among genome researchers and bioethicists.°\"® However, little is\nknown about the views of individuals from minority populations. Moreover, despite some evidence that\npreferences and potential harms and benefits of receiving genetic results vary among people from different\nracial and ethnic groups, there is inadequate power to study this issue when respondents are recruited to\nreflect the general U.S. population. For this reason, most studies of return of ES/WGS results have been\nbased almost solely on results from European-American (EA) participants,°°® resulting in a major gap in\nknowledge about appropriate practices for offering ES/WGS results in communities other than EA. Rather\nthan risk disenfranchising a large, growing segment of the U.S. population, it is imperative to understand\nminorities’ conceptions of the potential harms and benefits of participating in ES/WGS research and\nassociated return of results. Important and unresolved questions about ES/WGS research involving\nunderserved minorities include: (1) what are the attitudes of racial and ethnic minorities toward participation in\nES/WGS research and to what extent are attitudes influenced by policies and procedures for return of\nES/WGS results? (2) what preferences do racial and ethnic minorities have about the offer and return of\nES/WGS results? (3) what outcomes do racial and ethnic minorities who receive ES/WGS results experience?\n(4) how do these answers compare to similar data from EA early adopters?\n\nTo begin systematically addressing these questions, | propose to complete the following specific aims, as a\nfoundation for developing and testing strategies for return of ES/WGS results to underserved minorities:\n\nAim 1: Characterize and describe attitudes of underserved populations toward return of ES/WGS\nresults in clinical and research settings. | will develop, pilot test, and conduct a survey on return of results\nfrom ES/WGS in African American (AA), Hispanic Latino/a American (HL), Asian American (AS), and Native\nHawaiian & Pacific Islander American (NHPI) individuals (n=800). The survey will assess attitudes toward\nreceiving results in the context of research participation and healthcare, specifically, attitudes toward types of\nresults, role of choice, benefits and harms, method of return, and sharing results. The instrument will include\nitems to assess dis/trust of research/healthcare/medicine, racial/ethnic identity (solidarity/centricism), genetic\nknowledge, experiences with genetics, and spirituality/religiosity. Correlations between these constructs and\nattitudes toward return of results will be assessed. The survey will be developed and evaluated for its cross-\ncultural validity and reliability.\n\nAim 2: Characterize individual preferences for receiving ES/WGS incidental findings. | will assess\nindividual preferences for categories of results in a sample of minority adults (n=90 total, 30 AS, 30 NHPI, 30\nHL) using the web-based tool, My46 (www.my46.org). Adults will undergo in-depth interviews and complete\nsurveys before and after setting preferences to describe their decision-making process including their\nexpectations and motivations for receiving different types of results. Data from AS, NHPI, and HL participants\nwill be compared to similar previously collected data from AA and EA.\n\nAim 3: Evaluate the outcome of returning ES/WGS incidental findings to AA. One hundred AA adults\nfrom the Minority Health Genomics and Translational Bio-repository Database (MH-GRID) Study at\nMorehouse School of Medicine who have undergone ES will be offered the opportunity to receive incidental\nfindings. Participants will complete surveys and be interviewed, both before and after receiving results to\nassess short-term outcomes including changes in health care utilization, behavioral and lifestyle changes,\nsharing genetic information, psychosocial impacts such as anxiety and depression, and attitudes toward\nreceiving genetic results. Results will be compared to data | recently collected from EA.\n\nSpecific Aims Page 99\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 2\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\n2. RESEARCH STRATEGY\n2.1 Significance\n\nMinority perspectives on the risks and benefits of ES/WGS, and the implications for return of ES/WGS\nresults for participation in genomic research, are largely unknown. Information about returning individual\ngenetic results to racial and ethnic minorities is limited, but it is clear that knowledge and attitudes toward\ngenetic tests vary among racial and ethnic populations, \" * 2\" 2° 4% ®*’4 and this can impact test utilization and\nwillingness to participate in research.’° | have shown that AA focus group participants identify a broader set of\npossible risks and benefits from ES/WGS than EAs, extending to families, AA communities, and society.°\nMoreover, despite evidence of greater than average interest in genetic testing in some minority populations, *®\n°8 minorities are less knowledgeable about genetics and genetic testing,““ ’ and frequently hold\nmisperceptions of genetic risk.” A major deliverable of this proposal is a quantitative assessment of the\nperceptions of the benefits/risks of receiving ES/WGS results in minority populations and a\ncomparison of these perspectives to those of EAs.\n\nFactors that influence decision-making in minorities about receiving ES/WGS results are poorly\nunderstood. Key factors in the utilization of individual tests include financial access to healthcare, ’®\nsocioeconomic status,” trust in medicine,** % ’° and cultural acceptability of genetic services.*° ®' The impact\nof each of these factors may differ in the context of returning ES/WGS results to minority research\nparticipants.” °* Focus groups with AA highlight how mistrust in healthcare may preclude sharing results with\nhealthcare providers and the importance of community social supports in results decision-making.® The\nmeaning and Clinical utility of genetic test results (such as BRCA7 testing) are known to vary across different\ncultural contexts;°**° and orientations to family, time, and spirituality are known to differ and impact utilization\nof genetic tests.°°** A second major deliverable of this proposal is the identification of the range of\nviews, compared to EA, that influence decisions about receiving ES/WGS results.\n\nNo data exist on whether the ES/WGS results return preferences of minorities vary by result type (e.g.,\ncarrier status, altered risk for complex disease, etc.) and predicted impact on health, or change over\ntime. An analysis of results return preferences from WGS in an EA family with a Mendelian disorder\nsuggested that preferences vary across result types and can change over time.®’ Preliminary data suggest\nthat AA participants’ preferences for results may vary more than those of EA participants; more broadly,\ndiffering cultural contexts may be important to preferences for results.’° The results from the studies | propose\nwill provide important guidance to researchers and Clinicians as there is robust debate about: (1) the best\nway(s) to categorize ES/WGS results for return, (2) whether unanticipated results should be returned, and (3)\nwhether result type will influence preferences for return.°” °° %°°° A major deliverable herein is to provide\ndata about minority preferences for results, by result type; and guidance on whether different or more\nflexible strategies for ES/WGS results return are necessary when minority participants are included.\n\nNo one has conducted a study of outcomes of selecting and receiving ES/WGS results focused on racial and\nethnic minorities. Outcomes may differ because genetic information has different cultural significance and\nresponses to genetic information are contingent on prior expectations. This study will assess whether\noutcomes of receiving ES/WGS results may differ for AA as compared to EA. Study results will\nadvance research on return of results with AA by assessing if commonly studied outcomes capture\nAA participants’ experiences in receiving results and inform the reliability of instruments to measure\noutcomes among AA participants.\n\n2.2 Innovation\n\nStudies of minority group attitudes toward return of genetic results have focused on whether individuals are\ninterested in receiving results and if they recognize commonly held concerns (e.g., privacy, genetic\ndiscrimination).°*\"°' Further, the heterogeneity of studies and study populations have precluded comparative\nanalysis of attitudes between populations. Preliminary data from my own work on ES/WGS and that of others\non return of results® ® 4” %% '* indicates minority research participants are likely interested in receiving\nES/WGS results, as seen in EA populations, but that concerns about potential harms may differ than among\nEA participants.'\" ' '*'°° This will be the first study to my knowledge to systematically assess\nattitudes on return of ES/WGS results and conduct comparative analysis between minority\npopulations. | will therefore be uniquely positioned to develop and test models for offering and\nreturning ES/WGS results in minority populations.\n\nWhile the information disparity between minority populations about return of results is a fundamental problem\nin translational genomics, research on AA participants’ attitudes toward and responses to genetic testing and\n\nResearch Strategy Page 100\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 3\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\nresearch is most developed. For instance, recent studies suggest that disparity in willingness and utilization of\ngenetic testing may more accurately reflect an informed difference than the effects of on-going inequality”, in\nother words, a choice. With this in mind, | will be the first to test how AAs respond to a preference-\ndriven return of ES/WGS results.\n\n2.3 Approach\n\nProject overview. This project utilizes both qualitative and quantitative behavioral research methods to study\nattitudes toward return of ES/WGS results, both in general and as a factor in participation in genomic\nresearch, preferences for specific types of results, and outcomes of receiving results among members of\nracial and ethnic minority groups. By working within and across multiple populations, | will study issues\nspecific to the experiences of a particular group and understand factors common to all groups (e.g., fear of\nracial discrimination). Aim 1 uses a cross-sectional online survey to solicit AA, HL, AS, and NHPI participants’\nattitudes toward receiving results, characterize constructs hypothesized to predict these attitudes (e.g.,\ndistrust in medicine), and evaluate the relationship between these attitudes and constructs. Aim 2 solicits\npreferences from HL, NHPI, and AS participants and uses in-depth semi-structured pre- and post-preference\nsetting interviews to characterize motivations and concerns about receiving ES/WGS results, the experience\nof deciding results preferences, and how to improve this process. These data will also provide an opportunity\nto explore reasoning behind main outcomes of survey. Aim 3 returns ES/WGS results to a cohort of AA\nparticipants, based on their preferences for different kinds of results, and uses a mixed methods approach\nincluding surveys and in-depth interviews to assess outcomes of receiving results over at least a 6 month\nperiod. Aims 2 and 3 utilize a secure web-based tool for return of ES/WGS results, My46 [www.My46.org]\n(see Dr. Tabor’s letter). My46 has three modules relevant to this proposal: (1) a Participant Preference Tool\n(PPT); (2) a Results Management Tool (RMT); and (3) a Survey and Assessment Tool (SAT). Each participant\nprofile is linked to a consecutive usage log of participant navigation on the site, including access data (log-in,\nlog-out), order, and duration of information resources visited on the site. Therefore, | will be able to collect and\nanalyze data about participant usage of My46, including when participants change their preferences.\n\n2.3.1 Aim 1: Characterize and describe attitudes of underserved populations toward return of\nES/WGS results in research and clinical settings.\n\nResearch questions. While individuals broadly recognize the potential for clinical/personal benefits and\nexpress interest in receiving genetic test results, underserved populations have been shown to differ in their\ninterest in individual tests compared to EAs.*® | seek to learn how cultural and social forms of identity influence\n(1) individuals’ understandings of the risks and benefits of receiving ES/WGS results, especially consideration\nof group harms and benefits; (2) whether or not ES/WGS results are desired; and (3) attitudes toward choice,\nmethod of return, sharing results, and other related issues. Facilitators and barriers to receiving results may\ndepend on interpersonal obligations that originate from intersecting family contexts, community contexts, and\nracial/ethnic identity. To explore the effects of these factors on attitudes toward return of ES/WGS results, |\nwill address four specific questions:\n\n¢ What are AA, HL, AS, and NHPI attitudes toward receiving ES/WGS results (i.e., perceived benefits and\nrisks, expectations, concerns) and do these attitudes differ by population?\n\n¢ Do attitudes toward return of results differ in the context of research versus healthcare?\n\n¢ How important are genetic knowledge and experience, and psychosocial constructs such as temporal\norientation, spirituality/religiosity, family centeredness, distrust of research/healthcare/medicine,\nracial/ethnic identity (solidarity/centricism), to attitudes about return of ES/WGS results?\n\n¢ Do relationships between attitudes and constructs differ among populations?\n\nParticipants & recruitment. Building on the formative research proposed in K-Research Aim 2, | will conduct\nan online survey of 800 AA, HL, AS, and NHPI working with Lake Research Partners (LRP), a national survey\nresearch company that specializes in research with racial and ethnic minorities (see Dr. Celinda Lake’s letter).\nAdults will be recruited from a commercial research panel that includes over 2.1 million active members\naccrued through online marketing with over 300 diverse affiliate partner organizations. The panel includes\n~678,000 individuals from minority populations (168,000 AA, 210,000 HL, 168,000 AS, 10,500 NHPI, 16,800\nAIAN, 147,000 other). LRP report an overall 40% response rate using this research panel that will require\ninviting approximately 500 individuals from each racial/ethnic group. The target of 800 respondents across\nfour underrepresented groups will allow for generalizability within and comparisons between these groups (to\ndetect a 15% difference in survey response proportions between two groups assuming .80 power).\n\nResearch Strategy Page 101\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 4\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\nSurvey Development and Validation. Building on K-Research Aim 2, survey domains will include attitudes\ntoward receiving results, in general, and as a factor in participation in genomic research, including the role of\nchoice, expected benefits and harms of receiving results, and preferences for different types of results;\nmethod of return; and sharing results. Items about attitudes will include those regarding respondents’ own\ngenetic information. The instrument will include items to assess distrust of research/healthcare/medicine'?’\"”?,\nracial/ethnic identity (solidarity/centricism)''® ‘''', temporal orientation'’?,  spirituality/religiosity, family\ncenteredness, genetic knowledge/experience, genetic numeracy/literacy, and standard demographic items\n(gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, income, occupation, perceived social status). Items from validated\ninstruments (e.g., Healthcare System Distrust Scale, Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, Zimbardo Time\nOrientation Inventory) will be used when available for predictive constructs, recognizing that validity and\nreliability have not been evaluated in multiple languages or in a survey on return of results. Items for\nremaining constructs will be developed in-house. The instrument will be pilot tested with at least 5 individuals\nfrom each population and cognitive interviews will be conducted with participants to improve face validity. The\nsurvey will be translated from English to Spanish, Mandarin/Cantonese, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.\nIterations of back translation and rewording will be conducted to ensure validity and comparability.\n\nSurvey implementation. A link to the online survey will be sent to adults who self-identify as AA, HL, AS or\nNHPI to obtain a total of 800 responses (~200 for each AA, HL, AS, and NHPI group). Two email reminders\nwill be sent to those who have not completed the survey to remind them of the link and to complete by the\nstated deadline. Adults who complete the survey will receive a thank you reward such as digital coupons.\n\nAnalysis. Univariate statistical analysis will be conducted to characterize participant responses overall and\nwithin racial/ethnic subgroups. A subset of demographic items and items to capture reasons for survey refusal\nwill be used to compare non-responders. Bivariate analysis will be conducted to characterize attitudes toward\nreturn of results and to assess differences between racial/ethnic groups. Differences will be tested statistically\nusing chi-squared or other comparable test. As a cross sectional survey focusing on characterizing group\ndifferences in attitudes, power is limited to detect differences between groups, whereas | expect to have\nsufficient power to evaluate selected attitude-construct associations in the overall sample. Therefore,\nassociations between selected construct measures and selected outcomes will be evaluated by regression\nanalysis overall, stratified by race/ethnicity, and adjusted for select demographic variables.\n\nDeliverables. Three major deliverables will compare similarities and differences in group perspectives toward\nreturn of ES/WGS results: (1) attitudes toward receiving ES/WGS results, including potential benefits and\nharms; (2) relationship between attitudes toward receiving ES/WGS results and participation in ES/WGS\nresearch; and (3) factors associated with attitudes toward receiving ES/WGS results.\n\nAnticipated challenges. To assess potential responder bias, which may threaten generalizability of\nfindings''’, | will query non-responders on selected demographic items for comparison to responders and\nreasons for refusal. Establishing construct validity of psychometric measure items and genetic terms in\ndifferent languages and cultures threatens comparabilty of findings between groups. To address this | will\nwork with LRP to conduct iterative translation and back translation of in-language versions, and conduct in-\nlanguage pilot testing and associated cognitive interviews to improve construct validity. Finally, generalizability\nof findings will be limited because lower SES respondents to an online study are likely to differ in other ways,\nfor instance, to lower SES patients seen in a community clinic.\n\n2.3.2 Aim 2: Characterize individual preferences for receiving ES/WGS incidental findings.\n\nResearch questions. Recent studies of preferences and public attitudes toward genetic information suggest\nthat most individuals seek all available genetic result information, do not distinguish between primary and\nsecondary results from research, and are motivated by the potential for both clinical and personal utility.4” °% ©\n\"4119 Yet many of these studies have been conducted among high SES, European-American “early\nadopters”'*” '*' enrolled in studies of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and studies of research participants\n\nand the public have focused on attitudes toward results, in general. In contrast,|UnPublished\nUnpublished\n\nUnpublished n this context, | plan to\n\nask the following research questions:\n\nResearch Strategy Page 102\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 5\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\n¢ Do underserved minorities’ preferences for genetic results from participation in ES/WGS research differ\nfrom those of “early adopting EAs” and if so, how and why?\n¢ Do particular orientations to time, family, cultural identity, and spirituality impact preferences for results?\n\nRecruitment. | will use the same existing collaborative relationships to recruit adult study participants as\ndescribed in K-Research Aim 2. Adults from underrepresented minority groups (n=90; approximately 30 AS,\n30 NHPI, and 30 HL) will be recruited from the UW Pediatric Care Center (UWPCC) and via local public health\nclinics and organizations including Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic (OBCC), Meredith Mathews YMCA\n(YMCA), and the Asian Pacific Islander Coalition Acting Together (APICAT) for Healthy Communities.\nRecruitment will include a mixture of phone, email, and flyer-based recruitment. | do not anticipate difficulty\nrecruiting 90 study participants and will provide a $50 giftcard as incentive. During the K-phase | will explore\noptions for recruiting AIAN with the Seattle Indian Health Board and adjust participant numbers accordingly.\n\nPreference Setting Sessions. Sessions will be modeled on my preliminary study with AAs. Adults will be\npresented a hypothetical research scenario where they have undergone WGS and are asked to set\npreferences for receiving results using My46. They will be given the choice to receive results for conditions\norganized by categories: disease risk, carrier status, genetic syndromes, medication response, and ACMG\nrecommended conditions. Preferences will be recorded in My46. Using the survey functionality of My46, they\nwill take a baseline survey before setting preferences to characterize demographics; experience with genetic\nand numeracy; health status, healthcare utilization and insurance status; self-efficacy; and orientations to\ntime, family, cultural identity, and spirituality. After setting their preferences, they will take a survey to describe\ntheir motivations and concerns about receiving genetic results. All participants will be interviewed before and\nafter selecting preferences to better understand their preference decisions in the context of their expectations\nand concerns, specifically what motivated their preference decisions. Interviews will be audio-recorded.\n\nAnalysis: Frequencies of participant preferences for results overall and by subgroup will be tabulated for all\nresults, results by category, and individual conditions. These data will be directly compared, both quantitatively\nand qualitatively, to those from AA and EA in previous studies. Associations between preferences and\nhypothesized predictors (e.g., experience with genetics) will be assessed in the overall sample of responses.\nMotivations and concerns from surveys will be described for each group. Survey analysis will be conducted in\nconsultation with the Center for Biomedical Statistics at the UW. Qualitative themes about motivations and\nconcerns will be identified from interview transcripts through content analysis using standard coding, notation,\nand memoing.*® Themes from the qualitative analysis and survey results will be compared between racial and\nethnic groups to identify similarities and differences. These data will be compared to those previously\ncollected among EAs and AAs (see Dr. Tabor’s letter). Group level survey analyses will be descriptive, due to\nlimited sample size, however, when combined with qualitative session data they will provide critical data for\ngenerating hypotheses about how minorities think about receiving genetic results from ES/WGS.\n\nDeliverables. Two major deliverables will characterize group perspectives on return of ES/WGS: 1) Analysis\nof preferences for managing results across racial and ethnic strata; and 2) factors that may affect preference\ndecisions including informational needs, demographic characteristics, psychometrics (self efficacy, ethnic\ncentricism, temporal orientation, religiosity), motivations and concerns about receiving genetic information.\n\nAnticipated challenges. A key challenge will be an ascertainment bias of participants who are predominantly\nof higher SES or of lower SES. To obtain a balanced sample, | plan to recruit from a wide variety of clinical\nand community setting and will include SES as an inclusion/selection criteria.\n\n2.3.3 Aim 3: Evaluate the outcome of returning ES/WGS incidental findings to AA.\n\nResearch questions. Several potential outcomes are expected from return of ES/WGS results including\nmedical treatment/prevention; psychological outcomes that may positively or adversely affect health-related\nbehaviors and lifestyle changes; sharing of genetic information with family members leading to cascade\ntesting; sharing results with healthcare providers expected to yield personalized healthcare; and changes in\nhealthcare utilization. Receiving results may also impact interest and willingness to receive additional genetic\ninformation in the future and even participation in genetic research. In this aim, | address two main questions:\n\n¢ What short-term outcomes do AAs experience from receiving ES/WGS results?\n\n¢ Do outcomes differ between EA and AA research participants?\nReturn of ES/WGS results through genetic counselor and My46. AA adults enrolled in ES/WGS studies\n(n=100) will be recruited to receive ES/WGS results through a combination of genetic counseling and online\nreturn of results tool My46. Time course analyses require a minimum of 75 participants at 0.80 power to detect\n\nResearch Strategy Page 103\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 6\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\na measurable difference of 21.97 points for the PHQ-9 and 21.5 points for the PAGIS overall scores\n(described below). Recruiting ~25% of available MH-GRID participants is likely and will provide a sample size\nof 100 to protect against individuals who may withdraw or may not have a returnable result. Mirroring the\nprocedures in Aim 2, AA adults will communicate their results preferences to study staff using My46. These\npreferences will be used to filter results offered for return. | will utilize an existing UW Variant Review Board\n(VRB) comprised of 12 medical/clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, genome scientists and ethicists,\nchaired by Drs. Bamshad and Burke to (1) decide which specific genes to assess for returnable results; (2)\nadjudicate returnable results in light of participant preferences; (3) provide guidance about what counseling\nshould be provided with each result. Each result will be validated (i.e., confirm that a result is not a false\npositive) in the molecular diagnostics service lab of the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine and offered\nfor return by a certified genetic counselor using My46. Ms. Seema M. Jamal, My46 staff genetic counselor, will\nreturn ES/WGS results with the aid of My46. Ms. Jamal has extensive experience as a genetic counselor and,\nprior to her current position at the UW, was an assistant professor in the genetic counseling program at\nBoston University. Ms. Jamal also has extensive experience returning ES results, specifically secondary\nresults as staff genetic counselor for a current study on returning ES research results (Tabor R01). Outcomes\nof receiving results will be assessed among all 100 participants using psychometric, behavioral, and attitudinal\nsurveys, and qualitative interviews with a subset of 50 participants.\n\nStudy population. AA participants will be recruited through the Minority Health Genomics and Translational\nResearch bio-repository Database (MH-GRID) housed at Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically black\nmedical school, which includes >435 self-identified AA adults with annotated ES/WGS variant data. Additional\nAA adults may be recruited from other studies housed at Morehouse who would undergo prospective\nsequencing at UW (see /etter of collaboration from Drs. Quarells and Royal).\n\nEvaluation of existing annotated exome sequencing data. Because of the costs associated with CLIA\ntesting, | will concentrate on returning results from existing clinical genetic tests. The VRB will select for review\n50 to 100 genes and associated phenotypes, including those recommended by the ACMG,” representing a\nrange of possible kinds of results that may be returned in ES/WGS studies. These will be largely based on\nrecommendations of NHGRI-funded projects studying return of results®’ and supplemented with conditions of\npublic health priority among the AA population (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, sudden death, Alzheimer’s Disease).\n\nAssess outcomes through participant Table 6.

Before and after receiving results, | will ask participants how often they see their\nhealthcare provider and about their health, disability, longterm care, and life insurance status. After results, |\nwill ask if they have visited or spoken to a healthcare provider since receiving results, if so, the kind of care-\nprovider contacted (e.g., genetic counselor, clinical geneticist), if they spoke about results, and what, if any,\ntests or evaluations were performed. (3) Health-related behaviors and lifestyle (T1/T3/T4). Before and after\nreceiving results, | will ask about common behaviors such as tobacco use, exercise, and nutrition; and include\nitems to assess atttitudes toward those behaviors. (4) Sharing results (T1/T3/T4). Before receiving results, |\nwill ask participants their intentions to share results. | will compare these intentions to post-results sharing of\nresults and query reasons for sharing or not sharing different kinds of results, and if and why they changed\ntheir plans about sharing. (5) Expectations for future results (T4). To assess if receiving genetic results\neither positively or negatively impacts preferences for additional results in the future, | will assess changes in\n\nResearch Strategy Page 104\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 7\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\npreferences for up to 6 months after initial results disclosure and ask participants their preferences for\nreceiving future updates on results that have been returned and their interest in receiving results in the future.\n\nThe Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research consortium Outcomes & Measures Workgroup has collected\ncommonly used measures under important domains and will be available to me for final measures selection.\n\nQualitative experience. | will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews with a sub-sample of 50 AA\nparticipants prior to receiving results, and 2-4 weeks and 6 months after participants have reviewed results to\nassess their experience and outcomes of receiving results. Interviews before results return will focus on\nparticipants’ expectations about receiving results. Interviews after results return will focus on learning how\nparticipants have responded to results (e.g., impacted their health-related behaviors and attitudes) and\nwhether the surveys adequately captured their response to results.\n\nAnalysis. Survey data will be analyzed to generate summary statistics. Responses to validated scales will be\nsummarized following published practices. Outcome survey data from AAs will be directly compared to similar,\nexisting data from EAs (n=150) who have received ES/WGS results using My46 or a genetic counselor.\nFollowing Table 6, | will (1) calculate differences in measures before and after receipt of results to assess\nimpact of results, (2) calculate differences in outcomes measures between 2-4 weeks and 6 months after\nreceipt of results to assess if outcomes are sustained over time, (3) summarize remaining single time point\nmeasures and (4) compare data from AAs and EAs to test for differences in impact of receiving results,\nchanges overtime, and other single time point measures between AAs and EAs. | will evaluate effects of SES\nvariables such as income, education, occupation, perceived social status, as well as health literacy and\nnumeracy all of which have been shown to impact outcomes. Qualitative thematic analysis from interviews will\nbe conducted and results compared to interviews previously conducted with EAs (see Dr. Tabor’s letter).\n\nDeliverables. Through this study, | will (1) characterize the short term outcomes of receiving ES/WGS results\namong AA adults and determine if these outcomes are sustained over a 6 month period and (2) produce a\ncomparison of outcomes between AA and EA cohorts. Through a comparison of qualitative interview data and\nsurvey assessments of outcomes, | will (3) assess whether selected outcomes accurately capture/reflect\nthose deemed important by AA participants and whether additional constructs need to be explored in future\nstudies involving AA participants.\n\nAnticipated challenges. Retention of study participants to study completion is a challenge | will address by\nproviding incentives for completing each phase of the study including surveys and interviews. Some\nparticipants might not have results eligible for return. Given that ES/WGS data will be available from each\nindividual, | will supplement the number of genes assessed in any particular individual so as to capture at least\none result for return.

Research projects proposed\nin this K99ROO include both exempt and non-exempt research.\n\nK-Research Aim 1 and 2, and R00-Specific Aim 1\n\nThis human subjects’ research falls under exemption category 2. These projects and aims use\nfocus group, cognitive interview, and survey methodologies to conduct qualitative and\nquantitative research on attitudes toward genetic research and return of ES/WGS results. None\nof these require completion of a task or conduct of an intervention.\n\nRisk to Subjects\n\nHuman Subjects Involvement and Characteristics\n\nA total of n=1240 (40 participants for interviews in K-Research Aim 1; 200 survey respondents\nin K-Research Aim 1; 200 focus group participants in K-Research Aim 2; and 800 survey\nrespondents in ROO-Specific Aim 1) subjects ages 18 and over will be recruited for focus\ngroups, interviews, or survey. Subjects for K-Research Aim 2 and ROO Aim 1 will be recruited\nwho self-identify as African American (AA), Hispanic/Latino American (HL), Native Hawaiian\nPacific Islander (NHPI) or Asian American (AS). Subjects for K-Research Aim 1 will be\nrecruited from community health clinics and community-based organizations that serve African\nAmerican (AA), Hispanic/Latino American (HL), Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander (NHPI) or\nAsian American (AS) populations. Preferrably, individuals who self-identify as members of these\nracial and ethnic groups will be recruited as interview participants in the K-Research Aim 1.\n\nSource of Materials\n\nSubjects for K-Research Aim 1 interviews and surveys will be from Federally Funded Federally\nQualified Health Centers, commonly referred to as community health centers (CHCs), and from\ncommunity-based organizations (including federally recognized tribal facilities) identified from\npublic directories from national minority health organizations. Subjects for K-Research Aim 2\nfocus groups will be recruited from the University of Washington Pediatric Care Center (see Dr.\nJeffry Wright's letter of commitment), Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic (see Dr. Ben Danielson\nletter of commitment), Meredith Mathews YMCA of Greater Seattle (see Chip Byrne’s letter of\ncommitment), APICAT (see Elaine Ishihara’s letter of commitment) and existing studies\ninvolving Hispanic Latino(s) Americans (see Dr. Beti Thompson letter of commitment). Subjects\nfor the ROO-Research Aim 1 survey will be recruited through Lake Research Partners and their\nonline vendors (see Celinda Lake’s letter of commitment). Although, | will receive those data as\nanonymous data, | will review their recruitment protocols and data collection methods to ensure\nthat they are following human subjects regulations appropriate for research.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nParticipants may experience discomfort when answering focus group, interview or survey\nquestions about their own experiences or feelings. Although we will ask participants to keep\nwhat is said in focus group discussions in confidence, participants may repeat things said during\nthe focus group to others. All the procedures that will be carried out during this study are\nbelieved to represent very low risks or have no known medical risks to date.\n\nAdequacy of Protections Against Risks\n\nProtection of Human Subjects Page 106\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 9\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\nRecruitment and Informed Consent\nRecruitment for K-Research Aim 1 of individuals identified from publicly available lists will be\nconducted by email, if available, or by letter. A maximum of three attempts by phone or email\nwill be made to encourage participation in the interview and or survey. Focus group recruitment\n(K-Research Aim 2) will involve a mixture of direct phone solicitation of eligible adults when lists\nare available, electronic and paper directed advertising (i.e., study flyer and study postcards)\nwhen eligible individuals visit the UWPCC, and if necessary onsite face-to-face recruitment.\nStudy flyers will be posted on public bulletin boards at community organizations with the\norganization’s approval. | will either contact eligible adults from call lists or respond to inquiries\nby phone. During the phone call, staff will explain the content of the study and assess their\neligibility and availability for specific focus group dates and times. A letter describing the study\nand directions to the focus group or interview will be mailed to those interested in participating.\nStudy staff will follow up by phone to answer questions about the study and confirm the date\nand time. Recruitment for ROO-Research Aim 1 will involve sending an invitation to participate\nin an online survey via email. Up to three reminder emails will be sent to encourage\nparticipation.\n\nAs exempt research, subjects will be provided a written statement describing the study\npurpose, procedures, risks and benefits, human subject protections, confidentiality, and\nalternatives to participation; and will not undergo a written consent procedure.\n\nProtections Against Risk\n\nWhen study staff contact eligible individuals by phone, no more than 3 call attempts will be\nmade for recruitment. Subjects will be informed that they do not have to answer any questions\nand are free to withdraw from the study at any time. At the start focus groups, the moderator will\nreiterate that our discussion is confidential and that we ask participants to be respectful of each\nother. All personal information will be kept in locked cabinets and on password-secured\ncomputers. Although we will have access and collect contact information for the purposes of\nrecruitment, that information will not be linked to audio files or transcripts. Any inadvertently\ncaptured personally identifiable information will be redacted from transcripts. Audio-recordings\nwill be destroyed within 2 years of the completion of the study.\n\nPotential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others\n\nThe focus group, interview, and survey data will help investigators better understand attitudes\ntoward return of ES/WGS results. While there are minimal risks involved in participating in this\nstudy, there are no direct benefits to subjects. The risk benefit ratio for individual subjects is\nvery low.\n\nImportance of the Knowledge to be Gained\n\nThe proposed research will benefit researchers in genome science and ethics, as well as policy\nmakers and IRBs, by providing empirical data about how to discuss and return the kinds of\nresults that will be identified from exome and whole genome sequencing research in a range of\nracial and ethnic populations. This will facilitate the ethical conduct of this research in a way that\nbenefits participants in the future.\n\nRO0O-Specific Aim 2\nThis research is non-exempt because the potential to link study data with personal identifiable\n\ninformation will be maintained and because participants will be asked to set their preferences for\nresults and complete surveys using the online tool My46.\n\nProtection of Human Subjects Page 107\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 10\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\nRisk to Subjects\n\nHuman Subjects Involvement and Characteristics\n\nA total of n=90 subjects ages 18 and over will be recruited for interviews.

While there are minimal risks involved in participating in this\nstudy, there are no direct benefits to subjects. The risk benefit ratio for individual subjects is\nvery low.\n\nImportance of the Knowledge to be Gained\n\nThe proposed research will benefit researchers in genome science and ethics, as well as policy\nmakers and IRBs, by providing empirical data about how to discuss and return the kinds of\nresults that will be identified from exome and whole genome sequencing research in a range of\nracial and ethnic populations. This will facilitate the ethical conduct of this research in a way that\nbenefits participants in the future.\n\nR00-Specific Aim 3\n\nThis human subjects’ research is non-exempt because of the potential to link study data with\npersonal identifiable information will be maintained and because participants will receive\nES/WGS results through a genetic counselor in conjunction with the online tool My46.\n\nRisk to Subjects\n\nHuman Subjects Involvement and Characteristics\n\nThis research will be conducted with African American subjects (n=100), ages 18 years old or\nover, recruited from existing studies involving whole genome or exome sequencing. Original\nstudies will either have ongoing contact with subjects or have IRB approval for re-contact and\nconsent for other projects. Written information and biological samples (blood, buccal cells,\nsaliva) will be collected from each study subject for CLIA-validation of results to be returned.\n\nSources of Materials\n\nHuman subjects enrolling in the research outlined in this proposal will be ascertained from on-\ngoing exome or whole genome sequencing studies, specifically MH-GRID (see Dr. Rakale\nQuarell and Dr. Charmaine Royal's letter of commitment). Samples of blood, saliva, or buccal\ncells from which DNA is to be extracted (for validation of results to be returned) will be shipped\ndirectly to a CLIA approved laboratory at the University of Washington for CLIA validation.\nQualitative and quantitative data from subjects will be collected from interviews and online\nsurveys and validated tools, including data about psychological, social and health-related\nresponses to receiving results.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nPotential physical risks of this project include discomfort, mild pain and slight bruising at the\nphlebotomy site for the blood draw for the CLIA validation of returnable results. This project is\nexplicitly designed to study genetic information about individuals that may be revealed by the\nanalysis of the whole genome and exome sequencing data, information that may sometimes be\nunexpected. This includes potential results both related and unrelated to the disease that was\nthe original focus of investigation. Participants will be given the option to not receive some or all\noffered results at the beginning of the study. They will also be able to decline participation in this\nstudy, while still participating in the original studies. A Variant Review Board (led by Drs.\nBamshad and Burke) composed of bioethicists, geneticists and genetic counselors, and experts\nin regulatory issues, will carefully review possible results of clinical significance and utility that\nshould be considered for return to individual participants. The Variant Review Board and the\n\nProtection of Human Subjects Page 109\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 12\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\nresearch team will develop protocols for the return of results tool and genetics counseling to\nprovide individuals with information about the meaning of possible results and options for next\nsteps. Additional genetic counseling will be available to all participants after they have received\nresults and thereafter for the duration of the study. One possible risk to subjects involves\npotential compromised confidentiality and potential psychological harm if unexpected genetic\nfindings are determined appropriate to return to individual subjects. Loss of confidentiality will be\nmitigated by strict adherence to secure data practices. Result information will not be\nincorporated into participants’ medical records.\n\nAdequacy of Protection Against Risks\n\nRecruitment and Informed Consent\n\n| will work closely with the Principal Investigators of the original studies, and their institutional\nIRBs, to coordinate recruitment and informed consent of subjects for this study. Only subjects\nfrom original studies that have permission in their consent forms to re-contact participants about\nadditional research will be included in this study. The recruitment and informed consent process\nwill take place in four steps. First, the original study principal investigators will obtain IRB\nmodifications, if needed, from their institutional IRBs to approach participants about participation\nin this study. Once approved, participants will be re-contacted by letter or by phone to either\nobtain permission for us to contact them directly, or to allow them the option to opt-out if they do\nnot wish to be contacted. Second, our study coordinator will contact the participants by letter, e-\nmail or phone to recruit them. The coordinator will screen individuals by having them complete\ncomplete a baseline Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale (PHQ-9) assessment.®\nIndividuals who score over 15 will be excluded to avoid enrolling participants who may be more\nlikely to suffer adverse psychological responses to results. Participants will be excluded if they\nare not willing to obtain a confirmatory blood/buccal sample for CLIA validation of samples.\nInformed consent will take place by video chat or phone, and participants will return signed\nconsent/assent forms to study staff. The Bamshad lab has been using this informed consent\nprotocol for several years for other studies. Following receipt of the informed consent\ndocuments, participants will be sent kits for blood/buccal sample collection that will be shipped\nfor CLIA certified testing.\n\nThe Bamshad lab has developed informed consent materials and forms that describe: 1) exome\nand whole genome sequencing (ES/WGS), 2) the kinds of results that can be identified from\nES/WGS, 3) the limitations on the interpretations of those results, and that meaning of these\nresults may change over time, 4) the need for CLIA validation of any genetic results with an\nadditional DNA sample, 5) potential risks and benefits from different kinds of genetic results to\nindividuals and to their family members/children.\n\nProtections Against Risk\n\nTo minimize discomfort to participants an effort is made to obtain biological samples from\nprocedures carried out as part of a participant's routine clinical care. Every effort is made to\nprotect confidentiality. All clinical information and biological samples will be labeled with a\ncoded number without any reference to individual identity. All identifiers will be stored in a\nprotected database isolated from the network and a back-up will be made on a separate\nencrypted storage device that will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the locked study coordinator\noffice. Access to the clinical data will be available only to approved staff. The identity of subjects\nwill not be revealed in any publications, slides, presentations or other materials. Our current\nIRB approval is in compliance with HIPAA regulations. All research planned in this application\nwill be performed at the University of Washington. Electronic data captured by the My46 has\nbeen configured to ensure access is secure in compliance with HIPAA regulations.\n\nProtection of Human Subjects Page 110\n\n\n==================================================\nPage 13\n==================================================\n\nContact PD/PI: Yu, Joon Ho\n\nPotential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others\n\nParticipants will potentially benefit by having the opportunity to learn about genetic results from\nexome or whole genome sequencing that are of clinical or personal utility, and that may affect\ntheir health or life planning in a positive way. These results may be about the disease that they\nor someone else in their family has, and they may also be about other conditions. It is also\npossible that some participants may not have any returnable findings among the genes studied.\n\nImportance of the Knowledge to be Gained\nThe proposed research on returning results will benefit researchers in genome science and\nethics, as well as policy makers and IRBs, by providing empirical data about how to discuss and\nreturn the kinds of results that will be identified from exome and whole genome sequencing\nresearch with underrepresented minorities.\n\nProtection of Human Subjects Page 111",

Jamal, My46 staff genetic counselor, will return ES/WGS results with the aid of My46.” (Page 6)\n\n#### Strengths:\n- Experienced mentors and collaborators; cross-institutional partnerships supported by formal letters (“see Drs. Bamshad and Burke”, Page 6).\n- Institutional resources support multi-site recruitment and secure, HIPAA-compliant informatics tools (“My46...has been configured to ensure access is secure in compliance with HIPAA regulations”, Page 12).\n\n#### Weaknesses (≥1):\n- **Minor:** Some referenced support letters and descriptions of mentor roles are not provided in detail in the extracted text (Not specified).\n\n#### Recommendations:\n- In the final document, ensure all mentor roles and lines of responsibility are fully described.\n- Attach or summarize content from referenced letters for completeness.\n\n---\n\n### F99/K00 Criteria Checklist\n\n- **Candidate:** Demonstrated track record and commitment (“I have shown that AA focus group participants...”, Page 2).\n- **Career Goals and Objectives:** Aligned with research and health equity (“This project utilizes...”, Page 3), but long-term academic independence could be articulated more fully (Not specified).\n- **Research Strategy:** Multi-aim, multi-method across underserved groups (Pages 1–7).\n- **Training/Career Development Plan:** Mix of research, psychometrics, and mentorship; use of innovative tools (My46); active engagement with mentors and relevant research centers (Pages 3–6).\n- **Mentors/Co-mentors/Consultants/Collaborators:** Diverse, multi-disciplinary team referenced (Page 6 and throughout).\n- **Environment & Institutional Commitment:** Strong, with dedicated tools, reviewed protocols, and access to national recruitment resources (Pages 3–6, 12).\n- **Transition Plan to K00:** Not specified in the extracted text, recommend making explicit in final revision.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Review Criteria\n\n- **Human Subjects:** Risks, recruitment, and protections outlined for each aim. “All the procedures...are believed to represent very low risks or have no known medical risks to date.” (Page 8); IRB and consent protocols detailed (Pages 8–13).\n- **Vertebrate Animals:** Not involved; not applicable (Not specified).\n- **Biohazards:** Not involved; not applicable (Not specified).\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not specified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Authentication of Key Resources:** My46 and secure data protocols described: “Electronic data captured by the My46 has been configured to ensure access is secure in compliance with HIPAA regulations.” (Page 12)\n- **Budget and Period of Support:** Not specified in the provided text.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Impact Score (1–9)\n- **Score:** 3\n\n#### Justification:\nThis application proposes a methodologically rigorous, high-impact study addressing a critical gap: the perspectives and experiences of racial/ethnic minorities in the return of ES/WGS results. The aims are logical, innovative, and well-integrated. The candidate demonstrates relevant experience and a strong commitment to health equity. Mentoring and research environment are strong. Weaknesses, such as ascertainment bias and some lack of detail regarding career trajectory and the F99→K00 transition, are relatively minor compared to substantial strengths. The likelihood that this project will exert a sustained, significant influence on return-of-results policy and genomic equity is high, provided minor recommended clarifications are addressed.\n\n---\n\nIf more details (e.g., career development plan, mentor statements, or budget/transition specifics) become available, some sections can be updated for completeness and further specificity.\n\nRespectfully,  \nGuevara_NIH_K99_Reviewer_B",

generalizability and representativeness of minority samples, as noted by the PI (Page 4)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Articulate detailed milestones and a clear path to independence for the K00 phase.\n- Add targeted strategies to mitigate selection bias and enhance generalizability (e.g., more diverse recruitment channels, clearer SES balancing methods).\n\n---\n\n## Significance\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Fills an acknowledged, substantial gap: “...major gap in knowledge about appropriate practices for offering ES/WGS results in communities other than EA.” (Page 1)\n- The potential to inform best practices and policies: “The proposed research will benefit researchers in genome science and ethics, as well as policy makers and IRBs...” (Pages 9, 13)\n- Empirical focus on underrepresented groups, aligning with NIH and national priorities for health equity and diversity\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Broader societal and healthcare system implications (beyond immediate study groups) are not deeply discussed.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Expand the significance section to highlight how study findings might inform national and international policy and clinical practice guidelines, and address long-term implications for reducing health disparities.\n\n---\n\n## Investigators\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Strong track record in relevant research: “I have shown that AA focus group participants identify a broader set of possible risks and benefits from ES/WGS than EAs...” (Page 2)\n- PI demonstrates appropriate expertise in genomic ethics and community-based research methods.\n- Broad multidisciplinary team (e.g., “VRB comprised of 12 medical/clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, genome scientists and ethicists...”, Page 6)\n- Key collaborations and advisory input from leaders in the field, supported by referenced letters (Pages 3–6)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The specific roles and ongoing engagement of co-mentors and collaborators are referenced by name but are not fully elaborated in the provided text.\n- Details about the candidate’s plans for achieving research independence after K00 are under-specified.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Provide explicit descriptions of co-mentor and collaborator roles, including frequency and form of ongoing engagement.\n- Include a clear narrative or table outlining progress markers for transition to PI independence.\n\n---\n\n## Innovation\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Novel focus: “This will be the first study to...systematically assess attitudes on return of ES/WGS results and conduct comparative analysis between minority populations.” (Page 2)\n- Integration of both qualitative and quantitative methods to capture nuanced perspectives (Page 3)\n- Unique use of My46, a validated, participant-centered digital tool for preference setting and return of results (Pages 5–6)\n- Cross-cultural, multi-language survey development and validation\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some elements (survey-based research, focus groups) are established methods, and innovation primarily lies in their targeted application.\n- Comparative dimension with European-Americans could be expanded to include other underrepresented populations or global contexts.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Articulate how innovative elements (digital tools, analytic frameworks, recruitment strategies) advance the field beyond prior studies and what new generalizable knowledge is generated.\n- Consider including a section on how the methodology could be adapted for global or additional underrepresented groups.\n\n---\n\n## Approach\n\n**SCORE:** 3\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear, feasible multi-aim approach, with comprehensive methodology (Pages 1–7)\n- Strong attention to survey instrument validation and translation, use of validated scales where available (Page 4)\n- Sample size, power, and statistical plan adequately described for all aims (Page 3–4)\n- Thorough risk mitigation strategies, including plans to address ascertainment bias (Page 4)\n- Integration of qualitative and quantitative data enhances robustness of findings (Pages 5–7)\n- Explicit assessment of anticipated challenges and limitations, with strategies to address them laid out in each aim (Page 4–7)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some residual risks regarding sample representativeness and comparability (“Generalizability of findings will be limited...lower SES respondents...differ...from patients seen in community clinics.” Page 4)\n- The transition plan from F99 to K00 phase is not described in detail.\n- Reliance on referenced letters for some key logistics and mentorship elements, which are not provided in the extracted content.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Provide more detail on participant tracking, retention strategies, and SES balancing to ensure representative sampling.\n- Include a detailed timeline and developmental milestones for the F99 to K00 transition.\n- Attach key support letters or synthesize main commitments and resources contributed.\n\n---\n\n## Environment\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Exceptional access to needed resources: “My46 is a robust resource...secure in compliance with HIPAA regulations” (Page 12)\n- Institutional support for multi-site recruitment through established partnerships (Pages 3–4, 8–11)\n- Access to relevant bioinformatics, statistical, mentoring, and clinical support teams (“Center for Biomedical Statistics...”, Page 5)\n- Letters of commitment referenced from multiple collaborating institutions and organizations (Pages 3–7)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some referenced resources, such as environment/commitment letters and detailed mentor statements, are not included in the provided excerpts.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Add succinct summaries of each referenced collaborator/mentor letter, clarifying concrete resource and support commitments.\n- If not already included, provide institutional letters verifying support for research space, computational infrastructure, and protected time for mentored research.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal presents a methodologically robust and policy-relevant study, promising significant advances in our understanding of minority perspectives on the return of exome and whole genome sequencing results. The strengths include its rigorous approach, innovative integration of validated digital tools and culturally attuned methodologies, and strong mentorship/environment. Weaknesses are limited to further specification of career development and transition plans, more explicit and detailed tracking of sample generalizability, and the need for all referenced support documents to be readily accessible. If these are addressed, the project is well-positioned to make substantial contributions to the ethical, equitable practice of genomic medicine and participant engagement in research.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nClarify and expand key logistical and transition elements, deepen the discussion of broader societal implications, and ensure all supporting documentation and commitments are explicit and accessible. These small improvements could elevate an already excellent proposal into an exemplar for F99/K00 applications in genomic ethics and health equity.\n\nRespectfully,  \nGuevara_NIH_K99_Reviewer_B",
