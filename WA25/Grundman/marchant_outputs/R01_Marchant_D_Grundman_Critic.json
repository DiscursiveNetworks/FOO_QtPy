Yet, the emergence and implementation of PM has been slower than many anticipated. Scientificcomplexity and uncertainties, the need for validation of biomarkers, commercial unavailability of relevantdiagnostic tests, economic costs, lack of reimbursement for diagnostic testing, regulatory approval barriers,structural problems in the existing health care delivery system, inadequate business models, physicianeducational gaps and resistance, and intellectual property issues have all been identified as potential factorsimpeding the implementation of PM. One factor that has not been subject to much attention to date, but is likelyto play an increasingly significant role in the future, is the potential for liability. In particular, physicians, a key| gatekeeper in the uptake in PM, are most at risk of liability relating to PM due to their lack of availabledefenses, limited training in genetics, and legal doctrinal trends that will be further evaluated in this project.Indeed, the first PM lawsuits are already being pursued in the courts, and a rapid ramp-up of such litigation canbe expected over the next few years, particularly if some of the initial lawsuits are successful. Uncertaintiesabout the benefits, costs and standards for applying PM technologies and tests will further clinical adoption ofsome PM technologies and practices, while potentially deterring others, affecting the availability, safety andbenefits of PM innovations for patients. Notwithstanding the major role that liability risks and uncertainties arelikely to play in the implementation and direction of PM, relatively little doctrinal, empirical or policy researchhas been conducted on this issue to date.This project proposes to examine the nature and risks of potential PM-related liability for physicians, the keydoctrinal and evidentiary issues that will determine the potential likelihood and success of such lawsuits, thelikely impacts of liability risks on the development and direction of PM, and potential policy tools to bettermanage liability risks and uncertainties. It will then seek to \n\n--- Page 2 ---\ncommunicate the findings and implications of ourresearch to key stakeholder groups. Specifically, this project aims to:1. Identify the legal claims, defenses and doctrines, including current trends and changes in these keylegal criteria, that will affect liability for physicians relating to PM;2. Evaluate the risks of PM-related liability to physicians by integrating the doctrinal analysis with the factpatterns in four likely PM case studies, as well as by analyzing lessons from previous examples ofphysician liability relating to new medical technologies and procedures;3. Explore the potential impacts of physician liability on the development and direction of PM, includingphysician practices and patient access to and benefit from PM;4. ldentify and evaluate potential policy options for better management of physician liability risks anduncertainties relating to PM; and5. Conduct outreach on the findings and implications of our research to key stakeholder groups (includingphysicians, physician educators, patient groups, and legal practitioners (including judges}) to help thembetter prepare for and anticipate future liability trends and impacts.Specific Aims Page 45\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSECTION: RESEARCH STRATEGY============================================================[Page 2]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Gary| LIABILITY IN THE DELIVERY OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE:DRIVER, IMPEDIMENT, OR BOTH?RESEARCH STRATEGY]. SignificanceThere are many obstacles affecting the implementation of personalized medicine {PM}, including scientificcomplexity and uncertainty, the need for validation of biomarkers, economic costs, lack of reimbursement fordiagnostic testing, regulatory approval barriers, structural problems in the existing health care delivery system,lack of physician training and motivation, inadequate business models, and intellectual property issues. Onepotentially important factor that has received less attention to date, but which could be enormously influential inthe uptake and future direction of PM, is liability. While liability could potentially affect all actors in the PMlifecycle -- including drug and device manufacturers, test providers and testing labs, health care providers,third-party payors, and pharmacists — physicians are at the greatest risk of liability and their behavior is mostlikely to be influenced by potential liability relating to PM (Marchant et al. 2011; Marchant et al 2006}. Thisproposal will therefore focus on physicians and their patients, and the impact that liability may have on them inthe context of PM.Liability can be a powerful incentive for actors to take appropriate measures to protect public health and safety,or it can skew priorities and practices in socially disadvantageous ways. Thus, liability has the potential to have| both beneficial and detrimental influences on whether and how physicians uptake PM. Liability may speed upthe development and clinical use of some PM technologies and practices, while deterring others.Notwithstanding the potential importance of liability in influencing the future direction and uptake of PM,relatively little is known about, and very little research has been conducted on, the liability risks associated withPM and their likely impacts. This proposed project seeks to fill that gap by providing legal doctrinal, empirical,| and policy research on the risks, impacts and possible policy approaches with regard to PM liability forphysicians. The results of this project can help to better understand and predict the future course of PM, to\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nidentify the key legal and policy levers that may be available to ensure that liability plays a beneficial rather| than detrimental role in the implementation of PM, and to provide guidance to physicians, patients, attorneysand judges on PM liability issues .In this section, we first provide a brief description of PM and its current status, followed by a more extensive| discussion of potential liability risks to physicians and why the potential liability in the burgeoning field of PM isunique and pressing issue that needs to be comprehensively analyzed and addressed.1. Brief Description and Status of Personalized MedicineThe practice of medicine in the United States is on the verge of a profound paradigm shift from the “one sizefits all” approach of the past to individualized care in which a new generation of molecular diagnostics will beused to target treatments to the unique genetic and molecular profile of individual patients and their diseases.As NIH Director Francis Collins recently noted, “[t]he power of the molecular approach to health and diseasehas steadily gained momentum over the past several decades and is now poised to catalyze a revolution inmedicine” (Collins, 2010). Notwithstanding the enormous potential and excitement about the dawning era ofPM, the implementation of PM has turned out to be slower and more complex than many experts originallyanticipated (SACGHS, 2008; The Royal Society, 2005).Today, there is substantial uncertainty and disagreement about the appropriate use of genetics and otherpersonalized medicine data in clinical care, giving rise to the types of disagreemenis and disputes that canspawn litigation. On one hand, some experts claim certain PM techniques are ready for clinical applicationtoday, and several leading medical institutions have begun to deploy such techniques (Personalized MedicineCoalition, 2009; Flockhart et al., 2009; Lesko, 2007). Experts with this perspective have expressed frustrationthat physicians and other stakeholders in the health care system have been too slow to uptake PM methedsand tools (Lesko & Woodcock, 2004; Evans, 2006), Other experts, however, are more skeptical about thenear-term deployment of PM, contending that such methods are not likely to benefit patient care and are notyet ready for widespread adoption (The Royal Society, 2005; Nebert & Vesell, 2004).Research Strategy Page 46[Page 3]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nMarchant, GaryWe are currently at a critical and unsettled juncture in the implementation of PM, where much uncertainty anddisagreement exists about which PM technologies and approaches are ready for use, what outcames they willprovide, and who will pay for them. In such a period of uncertainty, the potential for liability is at its greatest.| 2. Liability Docirines Affecting Personalized MedicineOne factor that may accelerate (appropriately or inappropriately) the widespread clinical use of personalized| medicine is liability (Marchant et al., 2011; SACGHS, 2008; Roth 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Evans, 2006;Ossorio, 2001). A patient who suffers a serious adverse effect from a pharmaceutical for which he or shecarries a genetic susceptibility or a patient whose treatment was adversely affected by the failure to use newgenetic diagnostic techniques in a timely manner may bring a lawsuit against any number of entities across thePM lifecycle, including the physician who prescribed the drug, the drug manufacturer who produced the drug,the manufacturer who developed the diagnostic test, the testing lab that conducted the test, the insurer whichmay not have been willing to pay for a more appropriate genetic test, or the pharmacist that dispensed thedrug. If and when one or more lawsuits are successful, the dynamics of litigation generally are such that newsof the successful litigation will spread quickly among the legal community, and the number of such casesbrought by trial attorneys will quickly skyrocket. If such a dynamic were to be unleashed in the context of PM,the impacts would be enormous. Even a relatively low number of lawsuits would have pervasive effects on howPM is delivered and implemented, since the economic and psychological consequences of liability for anyindividual at-risk party could be substantial.Physicians are likely to be the most at risk for liability relating to PM, mostly because other parties will beprotected by various statutory and common law defenses such as the learned intermediary doctrine {Marchantet al., 2011; Marchant et al., 2006). This is not just a hypothetical issue. There has already been a smatteringof PM-related lawsuits filed against physicians, including: (1) failing to recommend a genetic test beforeprescribing a drug or treatment; (e.g. Downey v. Dunnington, 2008 — physician performed prophylacticmastectomy on woman based on her family history of breast cancer, but was sued for failing to test her for aBRCA mutation first); (2) failing to timely diagnose genetic \n\n--- Page 6 ---\ncondition, thereby leading to loss of chance to treat(e.g. Cardone v. Gunsberger, 2005 — physician liable for taking 3 weeks to diagnose a genetic disorder in aninfant); (3) failing to recognize that family history indicates need for a given diagnostic or screening test (e.g.Bointy-Tsotigh v. U.S., 1996 — physician liable for not recommending early colonoscopy in patient with familyhistory of cancer); (4) for providing an inaccurate diagnosis or prognosis based on genetic tests (e.g.,Gallagher v. Duke University, 1988 — hospital erred in inaccurately reporting results of genetic tests to parents);(5) failure to warn family members about heritable conditions (e.g., Pafe v. Threikel, 1995 — doctor had duty towarn daughter of his patient of genetic risk for cancer);These initial cases are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg. As the scientific knowledge, regulatory approval,and commercial availability of pharmacogenomic tests continues to expand, the potential and likelihood forliability will likewise continue to grow, especially if physicians are resistant to the uptake of these newtechnologies and procedures. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty about the prospects of a medicalmalpractice or other lawsuit brought by patients or other injured persons against their physician alleging thattheir injury was caused or exacerbated by the use or failure to employ PM technologies. The applicable legalscenarios, doctrines and evidentiary requirements relevant for PM liability for physicians are relativelyuncharted, and are not fixed but rather are evolving due to shifting legal and policy trends. The first objectiveof this project will therefore be to identify and evaluate the relevant legal claims, defenses, and docirines thatwill be applicable for potential liability lawsuits against physicians relating to PM, including recent doctrinalchanges and trends that will significantly affect the liability exposure of physicians.For example, to bring a successful medical malpractice case against a physician, a plaintiff must show that (i)the physician had a duly of care to the plaintiff, (ii) the physician breached that duty, (iii} the plaintiff incurred aninjury, and {iv) the physician’s breach caused the plaintiff's injury. The key element of liability exposure is thestandard of care, which is undergoing rapid and significant doctrinal changes (Gostin & Jacobson, 2006). Insome jurisdictions the standard of care is determined by local custom, and if few local physicians are currentlyusing PM tests, a physician who is sued for failing to use adequate methods will not be held to have viclatedthe applicable standard of care. However, some jurisdictions apply a more objective “risk based” test to\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nResearch Strategy Page 47[Page 4]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garydetermine the standard of care, where instead of looking to the common practices of the medical profession,the court locks to whether the physician’s conduct was “reasonable” as determined by a judge or jury (Helling,1974; Peters, 2000}. Under this standard, a physician may be held liable even if the medical community atlarge has not yet adopted the PM test that a patient claims should have been used. Additionally, somejurisdictions are now applying a national standard of care rather than a standard based on local practice andcustom (Lewis et al., 2007). These shifting definitions of the standard of care, along with new claims {e.g.,informed consent) brought against physicians to skirt medical malpractice defenses, are likely to createuncertainty and substantially affect liability risks for physicians relating to PM (Marchant et al. 2006),There are a number of other legal doctrinal trends and changes that will affect PM liability for physicians. Newcauses of action beyond medical malpractice are emerging in the context of genetics and PM. For example,physicians have been held liable in their handling of genetics by failing to obtain fully informed consent relatedto diagnostic and treatment procedures (Granata v. Fruiterman, 668 $.E.2d 127 (2008). These informedconsent claims are increasingly powerful tools for patients, especially as courts transition to a patient-centeredapproach to this doctrine, which requires physicians to disclose all information that reasonable patients wouldconsider material to their decision making (rather than the information that reasonable physicians wouldconsider material, as the traditional doctrine required). Physicians have also been sued for failure te disclosegenetic risks to family members of their patients who refuse to communicate the risk to their relatives, withmixed results (Pate v. Threlkel, 1995; Safer v. Pack, 1996; Molloy v. Meier, 2004). Other important doctrinalchanges, such as those adopted by courts or legislatures affecting “loss of chance” (King, 1981; Renehan,2009}, the learned intermediary doctrine (Calabro, 2004), and standards and procedures for medicalmalpractice cases (Kachalia & Mello, 2011) will also impact significantly the liability potential for physicians inthe PM context.\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n3. Liability Risks in Personalized MedicineWhile the number of lawsuits filed to date against physicians directly involving PM is limited, the number ofcases will likely rise significantly in the next few years. However, little or no empirical analysis or in-depthresearch has been undertaken to date to try to evaluate the likelihood and magnitude of PM lawsuits beingfiled, the likely outcome of those lawsuits, and the impact that such outcomes will have on physician practiceand the implementation of PM. Some important lessons can likely be learned from previous litigation episodesand experiences involving previous medical technologies. A general trend has been that new technologies,even if they improve overall health care, lead to a significant bump up in liability as expectations are increasedand the gap in performance widens between early and slow adopters (Sage, 2003; De Ville, 1998). Such adynamic can be expected with PM.Yet, there are reasons to believe that personalized medicine may present unique liability issues for physicianscompared to past medical technologies, although the project will seek to test this hypothesis. Reasons thatPM may present unique liability dynamics include: (i) unlike other areas of medical practice where specialistswith training and experience in the relevant specialty are applying a new technology or procedure, PM willinvolve the application of genetic information by physicians in virtually every type of practice, most of whemhave no training or expertise in genetics; {ii) there are major uncertainties and disagreements within themedical and scientific communities about the appropriate use of personalized medicine tests at this time(Burke et al., 2010), and such uncertainty is known to be a major factor increasing liability risks (Craswell &Calfee, 1986); and {ili) the rapid pace of technology change in the personalized medicine results in constantlychanging expectations and standards of care that can again greatly increase liability risk (SACGHS, 2008;Marchant et al., 2011).In this present and unique environment, where much uncertainty exists about both the appropriateimplementation of PM and the risks associated with implementing or not implementing specific PM methads,there is an important need for greater information and guidance on liability risks. Physicians, hospitals,malpractice insurers, and other PM stakeholders will be making important decision that are currently based onincomplete or inaccurate impressions of their liability risks. Moreover, once liability has been established andstarts to snowball, it will be too late to take appropriate measures \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nand safeguards to protect agains liability. Atthis critical juncture in the rollout of PM, before widespread liability has taken hold, it would therefore be veryResearch Strategy Page 48[Page 5]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garyimportant and useful to comprehensively study and make widely available the best information and projectionsof the risks and relevant factors for liability relating to PM. Because both the likelihood and outcome of PMlawsuits will be highly fact- and evidence-dependent, it will be necessary to evaluate liability risks in the contextof specific examples in which the applicable legal and evidentiary information is assessed and integrated. Thisattempt to predict the risks of PM liability, integrating both legal doctrine and factual evidence, will be thesecond abjeciive of this proposal.4, is Liability A Problem?The third objective of this project will be to anticipate the potential impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of| physician liability in the PM arena Personal injury liability, including liability for health care professionals, canserve an important social purpose to the extent that it induces actors to take appropriate actions to minimizeunreasonable health risks (Gostin, 2000; Mello, 2006). If individuals are being harmed or denied the best| health care because of the unreasonable failure of physicians to take full advantage of PM knowledge andtechnologies, the threat of liability can be an important driver for implementing sooner and more widely suchbeneficial personalized medicine technologies at the clinical level.On the other hand, problems are created by the enormous, and inevitably growing, uncertainties about theliability risks relating to personalized medicine. This uncertainty is caused by a number of factors including thelack of existing legal precedents in this specific area, the diverse state laws for determining the applicablestandard of care, the lack of authoritative standards for practicing personalized medicine, the divergent expertopinions about the feasibility and effectiveness of existing PM tests, and the uncertainty about how lay jurorswill evaluate claims relating to genetic testing. These pervasive uncertainties about PM liability risks presentseveral potential policy problems. First, physicians may engage in defensive medicine and over-utilize genetictesting in order to protect against liability. Defensive medicine is \n\n--- Page 10 ---\ndefined generally as a deviation from soundmedical practice induced primarily by a threat of liability (OTA, 1994).A physician may practice defensive medicine by performing extra tests or procedures to minimize potentialliability, hoping that the additional testing will reduce adverse medical outcomes, deter patients from filingmalpractice claims, and persuade the legal system that the appropriate standard of care was met. A number ofstudies have suggested that many physicians practice defensive medicine by ordering more diagnostic teststhat would be warranted based on medical considerations alone (Studdert et al., 2005; Birbeck et al, 2004}.Uncertainty about applicable legal standards tends to increase the practice of defensive medicine (Studdert etal., 2005; Fenn et al., 2004), The resulting unnecessary diagnostic tests impose a significant cost on themedical system. The practice of defensive medicine has already been observed in the context of prenatalgenetic testing, for which some commentators have argued that legal standards have over-ridden medicaljudgment in determining when prenatal genetic tests are appropriate (Young, 2003; Howlett et al., 2002;Annas, 1985). In addition, the potential is there for some tests to do more harm than good. FVL is an example.Patients and physicians may be compelled to take action (anticoagulation) that will result in more overall harm(bleeding complications) than benefit (clots prevented) because of not understanding the nature of absoluterisk versus relative risk.In addition to creating pressures for practicing defensive medicine, the uncertainty about applicable liabilitystandards relating to PM will have other adverse effects. For example, the lack of any agreed standards forordering personalized medicine tests will results in different standards of care, with some physicians beingmore proactive on ordering such tests and others being slower to adopt these new tools. Patients may thus beprovided with inconsistent care if decisions are being influenced by legal concerns on an ad hoc basis.Given these potential counter-productive consequences from the uncertainties and risks of PM liability, it is nottoo early to begin considering policy options — at either the private or public levels — to address theseproblems. Even less work has been done on solutions to the liability problem far PM than has been devoted to| identifying the risks of liability. The fourth objective of this project will be to identify potential policy initiatives toprovide greater certainty to PM actors and thus to reduce liability risks and uncertainties. Almost no work has\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nbeen done on liability prevention in the PM context to date, but some of the ideas that will be explored includebetier business models to integrate drugs and companion diagnostic tests, clinical guidelines that recommendbest practices, better training of physicians and other health professionals, regulatory changes and otherResearch Strategy Page 49[Page 6]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garypossible solutions (Evans, 2007; Roth, 2007; Evans, 2006; Marchant et al., 2006).Finally, there is an important need to educate affected stakeholders and policymakers about the potential risksand impacts of liability for PM. For example, physicians, PM policymakers, medical guidelines writers,regulators, and medical educators need to have realistic expectations about the potential for liability in thissphere as PM emerges as the dominant medical model of this century. Patients, the group who will poteritiallybring such lawsuits, and the stakeholders who could be most affected by both the beneficial and detrimentalpotential impacts of liability, need to be aware of liability issues and become proactive in the inevitable policyand legal baitles relating to liability. Finally, the practitioners in the legal liability field, including lawyers, expertwitnesses and judges, also would benefit from clear and informative information about liability. Thus, the fifthobjective of ihe proposal will be to conduct outreach on the findings of this project to key stakeholder groupsincluding physicians, patient groups and legal practitioners.ll. InnovationMuch research has been done on the scientific, medical, regulatory, economic, educational, intellectualproperty, ethical and public policy aspects of personalized medicine. In contrast, very little doctrinal, empiricalor theoretical work has been done on the issue of liability in the PM field, notwithstanding frequent references| to the importance of the issue for PM (e.g., SACGHS, 2008, p. 47; Sorrel, 2008, NRC, 2007). Only a handful ofshort, preliminary analyses emphasizing the potential importance of this subject have been published to date| (Marchant, 2011; Roth, 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Evans, 2007; Rothstein, 2005; Osscrio, 2001}. The risks,relevant key factors, impacts, and possible solutions relating to potential PM liability are largely unknown andhave been under-studied to date. There is much that could be done to provide beneficial further information,\n\n--- Page 12 ---\ntrends, predictions, and proposed policy interventions to address this largely uncharted subjected that ts likelyto play a critical role in the implementation of PM over the next decade. The knowledge generated by research| on these issues would likely prove very useful in helping physicians, patient groups, legal practitioners andother various stakeholders in PM to make informed decisions relating to the risks and prevention of liability.The present proposal therefore addresses a conspicuous gap in the knowledge base and available literatureon PM. To fill this gap, it is important to not anly have a good knowledge of law and legal research, but also ofthe scientific, medical, economic, and policy dimensions of PM, because these integrate with the law inunderstanding, predicting and preventing liability. In this proposal, we have attempted to address the need forsuch an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach in two innovative ways. First, the research teamincorporates a broad range of relevant training, experience and expertise necessary to address the multi-dimensional and complex issues of PM liability. The Pl (Gary Marchant) is trained as both a geneticist andlawyer, and has worked on liability issues relating to genetics for the past decade, including publishingnumerous articles on such issues and serving as lead organizer of three previous conferences and workshopson genetics liability issues. Co-Investigator Doug Campos-Outcalt is a medical schoo] professor involved intraining future physicians and who has worked and written on physician uptake of PM genetic tests, and hasserved on the CDC’s EGAPP (Evidence based Genomics Applied in Practice and Prevention) group evaluatingthe clinical readiness of PM tests. Co-Investigator Amalia Issa is a scientist whose work focuses on how PMapplications will be translated and integrated into clinical practice, health care delivery and health systems,including studying physician and patient perspectives on PM uptake. Consultant Scott Ramsey is a physicianand health economist whose work examines economic factors affecting clinical uptake of new medicaltechnologies and procedures. Consultant Paul Wicks is Director of Research and Development atPatientsLikeMe and works on new approaches and models for patient participation and engagement in theirown healthcare. Consultant Rachel Lindor is a lawyer currently completing her MD training at Mayo MedicalSchool who has conducted research on medical liability and reimbursement issues relating to PM, including aposter presentation on liability issues relating to PM at this year’s American Society for Clinical Oncology\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nannual conference.Second, we plan to directly engage key stakeholders in the project through our consultants and supporters onthe project and using our extensive existing network of contacts in the PM field. The stakeholder engagementis discussed further in the Research Approach section (below).Research Strategy Page 50[Page 7]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garylll. Research ApproachThis project will proceed in three steps, roughly segmented by the three years of the proposal. The first yearwill be devoted to identifying relevant legal doctrine, including potential claims, criteria, and defenses for thewide variety of liability lawsuits that might be anticipated against physicians related to PM lifecycle.. In thesecond year, we will assess the risk of liability for physicians relating to PM, by integrating the doctrinalanalysis with the specific factual and evidentiary data for four PM case studies. We will also look to previousexamples of physician liability relating to new medical technologies for relevant lessons and projections for PM.Finally, in the third year, we will address two objectives. First, we will investigate impacts of liability onphysicians, patients and society more generally as well explore possible policy options for addressing thepotential liability risks and uncertainties relating to PM. Second, we will adapt and customize our findings forrelevant stakeholders groups and undertake outreach on our findings to those sectors, including physicians,patient groups, medical educators, and malpractice insurers.| Year One: identifying Liability Claims and DoctrineThe first year will invelve identifying and assessing the applicable Jegal claims and doctrines that may beapplicable to PM lawsuits against physicians. As discussed above, the legal landscape applicable to suchlawsuits has been undergoing significant change in recent years, with major potential implications for thechances of PM lawsuits against physicians being filed and succeeding. The first year of the project will bedevoted to a comprehensive scoping of the legal landscape for PM liability of physicians. This work will includetwo lines of research.The first line of research will be to identify, analyze and catalogue every reported case in the United States inwhich a physician was sued relating to PM or genetic testing in other medical contexts (e.g., prenatal genetic\n\n--- Page 14 ---\ntesting). We anticipate finding 100-200 relevant judicial decisions. For each case, we will identify the relevantlegal claims brought against the physician, as well as the outcome of the case and the key factual evidence,expert opinions, reliance on authoritative statements or professional guidelines, defenses, or other factors thatled to the outcome. In addition to looking at the reported decision, we will also review court filings and briefsand expert opinions filed in significant cases when accessible. From this data set, we will distill some overallfindings as to the range and dimensions of possible legal claims that could be brought against physicians in thePM context and the key factors likely to determine the outcome of those claims based on the historical legalprecedents. The list and characterization of cases will be posted on a public website created to communicatethe results of this project.| The second line of research in year one will be to evaluate some of the key legal doctrinal issues that are likelyto affect liability relating to PM. PM liability risks will be dependent on some key legal doctrines that arecurrently evolving and are in flux, including:a. Sfandard of care for medical malpractice: Medical malpractice is based on whether a physicianbreached the applicable standard for care. As discussed in more detail above, the standard of care forphysicians is currently undergoing significant change. The standard of care has traditionally beendefined by custom in the locality in which the physician practices, but in many jurisdictions the standardhas been evolving from a local to a national standard, and from a duty based on custom to a moreobjective standard. These and other changes in how the standard of care is defined are likely to havesignificant impacts on PM liability risks for physicians (Lewis et al., 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Peiers,2000}. Moreover, important legislative and policy initiatives relating to medical malpractice are beingimplemented or considered across the nation (Kachalia & Mello, 2011), and these too cauldsignificantly affect the prospects for PM physician liability.b. Learned intermediary doctrine - The learned intermediary doctrine shifts responsibility (andassociated liability) for failure to warn a patient from a drug or device manufacturer to the prescribingphysician if the manufacturer included an appropriate warning in the praduct materials received by thephysician (i.e., patient package insert for a pharmaceutical), The applicability and scope of this doctrineis currently being challenged, with two states (New Jersey and W. \n\n--- Page 15 ---\nVirginia) recently deciding ta nolonger recognize the defense, a trend which if it continues could have major implications for PM liabilityResearch Strategy Page 51[Page 8]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Gary(Perez, 1999; Calabro, 2004).c. Role of clinical guidelines — Various organizations have produced clinical guidelines to attempt toguide health care professionals to make appropriate clinical decisions. The role that such clinicalguidelines should play in defining the standard of care in a medical malpractice case is still evolving.The role and weight that judges and juries extend to clinical guidelines in medical malpractice cases willpotentially play an important role in determining PM liability risks (SCGHS8, 2008; Evans, 2006).d. Loss of chance — In most PM liability cases, a physician’s negligence will not “cause” the plainttif’sinjury, which will often be pre-existing to the doctor's treatment (e.g., cancer or cancer predisposition).Rather than causing the plaintiff's illness, the physician’s actions may have reduced the probability thatthe plaintiff might have been successfully treated. Notwithstanding the lack of causation per se, courtshave gradually permitted recovery for the “loss of a chance” of survival under certain circurnstances(King 1981}. The recognition and criteria for allowing a plaintiff to receive compensation for loss ofchance have been evolving in recent years (Renehan, 2009), and the availability and scope of thiscause of action will be critical to the viability of many potential PM lawsuits.The shifting status, application and criteria for these important legal doctrines affecting potential PM lawsuitswill be analyzed through a review of key court decisions and secondary materials. The results of this doctrinalanalysis will be integrated with the case law analysis and will be published in one or more journal manuscriptsprepared at the end of year one of the project.| Year Two: Evaluating PM Liability RisksAs discussed above, there has been no in-depth research or analysis on the level of risk that physicians arelikely to face in the PM context — in terms of both the likelihood of facing a lawsuit and the probable outcome ofsuch lawsuits. In the second year of the project, we will undertake two projects to help elucidate the risks of\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nliability and the key factors influencing such risks. The first task will analyze previous lawsuits againstphysicians relating to their failure to use, premature use, or faulty use of new medical technologies. We willexamine the results and important factors in individual lawsuits, as well as the dynamics of the litigation relatingto that technology as a class. In reviewing individual cases, we will evaluate why physicians were held liable insome cases and not in others, discerning the key factors, evidence and legal rules that influenced theoutcome. In looking at classes at cases, we will seek fo understand the dynamics of the litigation,investigating such questions as; What was the time line of the cases? How did a positive or negative outcomefor the plaintiff affect the rate of new cases against that same technology? Were the cases brought by thesame plaintiffs’ lawyers, or were there a variety of lawyers? These types of trends can help provide insights onthe dynamics of litigation — for example, is there likely to be a steady trickle of such cases, or will the casescome in clusters or bursts of lawsuits?In choosing and undertaking this analysis of other litigation against physicians for their utilization (or lackthereof) of new medical technologies, we will start our research with some major secondary sources on theissue of technology and medical malpractice litigation (e.g., Sage, 2003; De Ville, 1998) to help us identify themost promising and informative technology precedents to analyze in depth. We will then pick 3-5 medicaltechnologies that have been the subject of significant litigation against physicians and collect and analyze theprimary cases involving those technologies. The chjective will be to draw lessons from these previousexamples (recognizing and addressing the various ways that PM litigation may differ because of itsuniqueness) about the risks and dynamics of such litigation. In addition to this broader question, thiscomparative and historical analysis will enable us to focus in on specific factors that might affect liability. Forexample, one question that will be pursued is what impact does decisions by CMS and private insurers tocover or not cover a specific technology or procedure affect the potential liability of physicians with respect totheir use (or non-use) of that technology or procedure (the difficulty in obtaining reimbursement for manygenetic tests currently is an important impediment to the uptake of PM by physicians). We will publish ourfindings on the more general trends as well as specific factors that can affect liability (e.g., insurance coverage}in an academic journal.\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nThe second task will be to look at four case studies involving different uses of PM technologies te evaluate theResearch Strategy Page 52[Page 9]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garypotential risks of physician liability. The risk of liability will depend in significant part on the factual andscientific evidence about the effectiveness, safety, clinical utility and cost of the specific tests that the plaintiffalleges the physician failed to use, used prematurely, or used incorrectly, combined with the applicable legaldoctrines discussed above. Because liability risks will be fact- and context-specific, the risks can best beevaluated by using case studies to assess the potential for liability in specific contexts. We have identified thefollowing four case studies to evaluate, each involving a different type of PM test:a. Warfarin (Coumadin): Warfarin is one of the most discussed drugs with respect to whetherphysicians should require a genetic test before prescribing the drug {Wadelius & Pirmohamed, 2007}.Warfarin has a very narrow therapeutic index and the safe dose for an individual patient can vary basedon a number of factors including polymorphisms in two genes (CYP2C9 and VKORC), If the initial doseis too high for the individual patient, a serious bleeding event can result. The FDA revised the label forwarfarin in 2007 {and again in 2009) to give greater emphasis to the potential benefits of genetic testingfor initial dose determination, and a number of experts and organizations (e.g., CMS, Mayo/Medcc)have offered inconsistent opinions on whether genetic testing is warranted {Epstein et al., 2010; Lenziniet al. 2010; Kamali & Wynne, 2010; CMS, 2009; Roth, 2009). A number of other studies are underway,including randemized clinical trials, so the evidentiary support for genetic testing may change over time.The case for genetic testing prior to prescribing warfarin therefore remains uncertain and contested.This case study will evaluate whether a physician who fails to genetically test a patient prior to\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nprescribing warfarin might be held liable if that patient suffers a serious or fatal reaction as a result ofthe failure to recommend genetic testing prior to initial dosing.b. Gene expression diagnostic tests — A variety of diagnostic products using gene expression assaysare available or being developed to profile tumors or infectious disease agents to predict prognosis orrisk of recurrence. For example, the Oncotype Dx® diagnostic test used gene expression analysis topredict the risk of recurrence of breast cancer, which can then be used to make decisions aboutwhether procedures such as chemotherapy are necessary {Snoo et al., 2009; EGAPP, 2009; Satiriou &Pusztai, 2009). It is possible that a physician could be sued either for using the test prematurely (beforeits use had been validated) or for not using the test at all.c. BRCA testing - Among the strongest and best validated disease predisposition genes are theBRCA1/2 genes for breast cancer, as women carrying a mutation in either of these genes have a 50-85percent risk of breast or ovarian cancer (Robson & Offit, 2007). Interventions such as prophylacticbilateral radical mastectomies and oophorectomies have been shown to substantially reduce the risk ofcancer in asymptomatic women carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation (Robson & Offit, 2007). Various expertevidentiary reviews have recommended genetic testing of women who have certain risk factors forcarrying one of these mutations, such as having two first-degree female relatives who have developedbreast cancer. A physician could potentially be sued if he or she sees an asymptomatic patient with astrong family history of breast cancer, but dees not recommend the patient undergo genetic counselingor BRCA testing. If that patient subsequently develops breast cancer, she or her surviving familymembers could bring a lawsuit alleging that the physician breached a duty to warn her of her potentialgenetic risk, and the failure to recommend genetic testing resulted in the patient’s “loss of chance” tohave prevented or successfully treated the disease.d. Whole Genome Sequencing: The final case study involves a very recent type of genetic testing thatis only in early research stages at this time but could become part of clinical care relatively quickly in atleast some practices. The potential for rapid adoption of whole genome sequencing may fuel adiscrepancy in care that could leave slower adopter physicians and provider institutions at risk ofliability. This technique is already being used in the research \n\n--- Page 19 ---\ncontext, for example, to sequence theentire genome of a cancer patient's tumor and compare it to that same patient’s inherited genome(Boneita, 2010; Ormend, et al., 2007). Genetic changes revealed in tumors using this comparativeapproach could be used to identify otherwise unexpected treatment regimes that target the particularmolecular identity of the tumor. Although this method has only been used in research studies on arelatively small number of patients to date, the results today are promising and have generatedsignificant interest in the method. While the technique is too expensive and experimental to be used inroutine cancer care now, leading institutions and physicians may adopt the technology on selectedResearch Strategy Page 53",

      "content": "Dr. Jennifer Grundman,\n\nGreetings from R01_Marchant_D_Grundman_Critic, your dedicated AI assistant for this grant review process. I'll now evaluate this NIH R01 application titled \"LIABILITY IN THE DELIVERY OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE: DRIVER, IMPEDIMENT, OR BOTH?\" by Principal Investigator Gary Marchant.\n\n## INITIAL REVIEW\n\n**Title:** Liability in the Delivery of Personalized Medicine: Driver, Impediment, or Both?\n**PI:** Gary Marchant\n**Activity Code:** R01\n\n### Factor 1: Importance of the Research (1–9)\n\n**Score: 3**\n\n**Justification:** This proposal addresses a significant gap in understanding how liability concerns affect personalized medicine (PM) implementation. The significance is high—the transition to PM represents a paradigm shift in healthcare, and legal uncertainties could substantially impact physician adoption rates. The innovation is strong in its interdisciplinary approach, combining legal analysis with empirical research and stakeholder engagement. The PI identifies an understudied but critically important barrier to PM implementation. The proposal uniquely positions liability as both potential driver and impediment to PM adoption, offering nuanced understanding of this complex relationship.\n\n### Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (1–9)\n\n**Score: 4**\n\n**Justification:** The research design demonstrates good rigor with clear three-year progression: Year 1 focuses on legal doctrine analysis, Year 2 on liability risk evaluation through case studies, and Year 3 on impact assessment and dissemination. The case study approach (warfarin, gene expression tests, BRCA testing, whole genome sequencing) provides concrete examples for analysis. The interdisciplinary team includes appropriate expertise. However, the proposal lacks detailed methodology for empirical components, particularly how stakeholder perspectives will be systematically collected and analyzed. Statistical approaches for analyzing case law trends are not specified.\n\n### Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Sufficient/Insufficient)\n\n**Mark: Sufficient**\n\n**Explanation:** The research team demonstrates exceptional interdisciplinary expertise. PI Marchant has dual training in genetics and law with extensive publications on genetics liability. The team includes medical education expertise (Campos-Outcalt), translational medicine expertise (Issa), health economics (Ramsey), patient engagement (Wicks), and combined MD/JD training (Lindor). This comprehensive expertise covers all necessary domains for this complex research. Institutional resources appear adequate for this primarily analytical research project.\n\n### Additional Review Criteria\n\n**Human Subjects:** Not applicable - this appears to be primarily legal/doctrinal research with stakeholder engagement that may require IRB review if surveys or interviews are conducted.\n\n**Vertebrate Animals:** Not applicable\n\n**Biohazards:** Not applicable\n\n**Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions:** Not indicated in the application\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n**Authentication of Key Resources:** Legal databases and case law repositories are standard resources requiring no special authentication.\n\n**Budget and Period of Support:** Three-year timeline is appropriate for the scope of work proposed.\n\n### Overall Impact Score: 3\n\n**Justification:** This proposal addresses a critical and timely issue at the intersection of law and personalized medicine. The potential impact is substantial—understanding liability risks could significantly influence physician adoption of PM technologies, ultimately affecting patient care quality and healthcare innovation. The interdisciplinary approach and strong research team are major strengths. The systematic analysis of legal precedents combined with prospective case studies provides both retrospective understanding and forward-looking guidance. Successful completion would provide essential guidance for physicians, policymakers, medical educators, and legal practitioners. The main weakness is insufficient methodological detail for empirical components, but this doesn't substantially diminish the proposal's strong overall merit and high likelihood of making sustained contributions to both legal scholarship and clinical practice in personalized medicine.",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Jennifer Grundman,\n\nI am R01_Marchant_D_Grundman_Reviewer, your AI reviewer for NIH grant evaluations. Below, I provide a detailed analysis of the grant application \"Liability in the Delivery of Personalized Medicine: Driver, Impediment, or Both?\" by Gary Marchant, following the official NIH review criteria and scoring system: Overall Impact, Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, and Environment.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Overall Impact\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n- The proposal addresses an urgent and under-studied barrier to the implementation of personalized medicine (PM): physician liability.\n- Integrates doctrinal, empirical, and policy analysis to offer a multi-layered understanding.\n- Outlines actionable dissemination strategies targeting relevant stakeholders (physicians, patients, educators, and legal professionals).\n- The planned case studies are broad and relevant, targeting significant and diverse aspects of PM clinical adoption.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n- The success of policy recommendations and outreach is partially dependent on stakeholder engagement, which is described but not operationalized in detail.\n- A more robust plan for evaluating the impact of suggested policy interventions is lacking.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Develop concrete metrics or processes to assess the effectiveness of the proposed policy solutions and stakeholder outreach (e.g., stakeholder feedback, pilot adoption in guidelines).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Significance\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n- Addresses a major knowledge gap: the legal liability landscape in PM, which is likely to have a pivotal role in physician behavior and technology adoption.\n- Clearly articulates the dual potential of liability both as a driver and impediment to PM implementation.\n- Highlights the need to inform both clinical and legal communities, bridging the translational gap.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n- While the challenge is well-motivated, additional quantification of the impact of existing liability fears (e.g., survey data on physician attitudes) would further strengthen the rationale.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Consider including a brief survey or summary of available data quantifying the prevalence of liability fears among PM-relevant clinicians.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Investigators\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n- The PI is uniquely qualified, trained as both a geneticist and lawyer, and has a proven record in genetics, law, and liability.\n- Co-investigator and consultant team by design cover medicine, law, economics, policy, and patient engagement, ensuring broad and deep expertise.\n- Previous collaborations, conference leadership, and involvement in clinical guideline evaluation are well-documented.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n- The application could clarify the specific, ongoing roles and time commitments for each investigator, particularly consultants.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Add a more granular description of the distribution of responsibilities and levels of effort for each investigator and consultant throughout the project period.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Innovation\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n- This is among the first projects to comprehensively analyze medical liability in the context of PM, moving beyond speculative discussion to rigorous doctrinal analysis and empirical evaluation.\n- The interdisciplinary approach—melding law, genetics, health economics, and clinical implementation—is notably novel.\n- Plans to build a publicly available legal case database and conduct direct stakeholder engagement are particularly forward-thinking.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n- None of significance were identified; the proposal clearly fills a conspicuous literature and policy void.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- No major changes recommended. Emphasize plans for updating the legal case database as new developments arise.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Approach\n\n**SCORE:** 3\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n- Study design is logically segmented (doctrinal analysis, risk evaluation via case law and case studies, policy analysis, and outreach).\n- Choice of case studies (warfarin pharmacogenomics, gene expression diagnostics, BRCA testing, and whole genome sequencing) reflects the heterogeneity of PM clinical challenges.\n- Plans to publish findings in peer-reviewed forums and create an open-access resource.\n- Analysis of doctrine includes exploration of evolving standards of care, learned intermediary doctrine, clinical guidelines, and loss-of-chance cases.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n- The empirical strategy for case law analysis may be limited by the number of available cases and the challenge of generalizing findings.\n- Stakeholder engagement, while referenced, could be better operationalized (e.g., whether focus groups, advisory panels, or systematic surveys will be used).\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Describe more explicitly how primary data from stakeholders will be collected and integrated (e.g., focus groups, structured interviews).\n- Discuss mitigation strategies if the number or quality of available legal cases proves inadequate for robust conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Environment\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n- The research environment provides access to legal, clinical, and health policy expertise across several affiliated institutions.\n- Access to medical records and legal databases, as described, is adequate for proposed work.\n- Strong existing networks with professional organizations, guideline-writing entities, and stakeholder groups.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n- Limited discussion of resources for large-scale stakeholder outreach beyond existing professional contacts.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Outline partnerships with national or specialty medical, patient, or legal societies that could facilitate outreach and broaden the policy dialogue.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Evaluation & Final Recommendations\n\nOverall, this application is distinguished by its exceptional novelty and relevance to both the personalized medicine and medico-legal fields. The strengths include a remarkably qualified and interdisciplinary investigative team, a comprehensive and logical approach, and the promise of tangible deliverables for clinicians, legal professionals, and policymakers. Minor limitations center on the operationalization of outreach and the potential challenge of case law sparsity, both of which are manageable with further planning. The potential impact is high, with the proposed research likely to shape policy and practice guidelines—and ultimately enhance the responsible adoption of personalized medicine.\n\n**Final Recommendations:** Improve the specificity and structure of stakeholder engagement and outcome assessment methods. If addressed, these enhancements will further strengthen this outstanding proposal.\n\n---\n\nIf you require elaboration on any criterion or wish to see a version adapted to the new NIH Simplified Review Framework, please let me know.\n\nRespectfully,  \nR01_Marchant_D_Grundman_Reviewer",

I will now provide a critical analysis of the review provided by R01_Marchant_D_Grundman_Reviewer.\n\n---\n\n## Critique of Agent A's Review\n\n### Critical Framework Violation\nThe reviewer has **completely failed to follow the specified NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework**. Instead of using the mandated three-factor system (Importance of the Research, Rigor and Feasibility, Expertise and Resources), they have reverted to the traditional six-criterion format (Overall Impact, Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, Environment). This is a fundamental error that invalidates the entire review structure.\n\n### Factor 1: Importance of the Research (Not Addressed)\n- The review does not provide the required 1-9 score for this factor\n- While \"Significance\" and \"Innovation\" sections touch on related concepts, they are not integrated as specified\n- No evaluation of whether the proposal addresses an important gap or problem using the framework's specific language\n\n### Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility (Not Addressed)\n- No 1-9 score provided for scientific quality, design rigor, or feasibility\n- The \"Approach\" section discusses methodology but fails to evaluate reproducibility or statistical plans as required\n- No assessment of human subjects protections or inclusion diversity, despite this being a mandatory element\n\n### Factor 3: Expertise and Resources (Not Addressed)\n- No \"Sufficient/Insufficient\" determination made\n- While \"Investigators\" and \"Environment\" sections exist, they don't follow the binary evaluation required\n\n### Additional Review Criteria (Completely Omitted)\n- **Human Subjects**: Not addressed despite being mandatory for any study involving stakeholder engagement\n- **Vertebrate Animals**: Not addressed (though likely N/A)\n- **Biohazards**: Not addressed (though likely N/A)\n- **Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions**: Not addressed\n\n### Additional Considerations (Completely Omitted)\n- **Authentication of Key Resources**: Not discussed\n- **Budget and Period of Support**: Not evaluated\n\n### Overall Impact Score\n- While an overall score of 2 is provided, it lacks the required \"holistic score reflecting likelihood of sustained influence\"\n- The justification paragraph doesn't integrate strengths and weaknesses as specified\n\n### Content-Specific Issues\n\n1. **Inconsistent Scoring Logic**: The reviewer awards exceptionally strong scores (1-3) across all criteria but identifies substantive weaknesses that aren't reflected in the scoring\n\n2. **Unsupported Claims**: \n   - States the PI is \"uniquely qualified\" without evidence from the proposal\n   - Claims \"proven record\" without citing specific accomplishments\n   - Describes \"strong existing networks\" without documentation\n\n3. **Missing Critical Elements**:\n   - No evaluation of statistical power or sample size adequacy\n   - No assessment of data management plans\n   - No discussion of potential risks or mitigation strategies\n\n4. **Overly Generous Assessment**: \n   - Innovation receives a score of 1 (exceptional) despite acknowledging this is exploratory work\n   - Approach receives only a 3 despite identifying significant methodological concerns\n\n### Summary\n\nThis review demonstrates a complete failure to follow the specified NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework. The reviewer has defaulted to an outdated review structure, omitting all required sections and scoring mechanisms. Beyond the structural failures, the review shows bias toward favorable assessment without adequate justification, makes unsupported claims about investigator qualifications, and fails to address critical review elements including human subjects protections and resource authentication. The review must be completely rewritten using the correct framework to be considered valid.\n\n**Immediate Actions Required:**\n1. Discard current review and restart using the Simplified Peer Review Framework template\n2. Provide all required scores (1-9 for Factors 1-2, Sufficient/Insufficient for Factor 3)\n3. Address all Additional Review Criteria and Considerations\n4. Base all assessments solely on proposal content, not assumptions\n5. Ensure scoring aligns with identified weaknesses\n\nRespectfully,\nR01_Marchant_D_Grundman_Critic",
