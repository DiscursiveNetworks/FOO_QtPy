Yet, the emergence and implementation of PM has been slower than many anticipated. Scientificcomplexity and uncertainties, the need for validation of biomarkers, commercial unavailability of relevantdiagnostic tests, economic costs, lack of reimbursement for diagnostic testing, regulatory approval barriers,structural problems in the existing health care delivery system, inadequate business models, physicianeducational gaps and resistance, and intellectual property issues have all been identified as potential factorsimpeding the implementation of PM. One factor that has not been subject to much attention to date, but is likelyto play an increasingly significant role in the future, is the potential for liability. In particular, physicians, a key| gatekeeper in the uptake in PM, are most at risk of liability relating to PM due to their lack of availabledefenses, limited training in genetics, and legal doctrinal trends that will be further evaluated in this project.Indeed, the first PM lawsuits are already being pursued in the courts, and a rapid ramp-up of such litigation canbe expected over the next few years, particularly if some of the initial lawsuits are successful. Uncertaintiesabout the benefits, costs and standards for applying PM technologies and tests will further clinical adoption ofsome PM technologies and practices, while potentially deterring others, affecting the availability, safety andbenefits of PM innovations for patients. Notwithstanding the major role that liability risks and uncertainties arelikely to play in the implementation and direction of PM, relatively little doctrinal, empirical or policy researchhas been conducted on this issue to date.This project proposes to examine the nature and risks of potential PM-related liability for physicians, the keydoctrinal and evidentiary issues that will determine the potential likelihood and success of such lawsuits, thelikely impacts of liability risks on the development and direction of PM, and potential policy tools to bettermanage liability risks and uncertainties. It will then seek to \n\n--- Page 2 ---\ncommunicate the findings and implications of ourresearch to key stakeholder groups. Specifically, this project aims to:1. Identify the legal claims, defenses and doctrines, including current trends and changes in these keylegal criteria, that will affect liability for physicians relating to PM;2. Evaluate the risks of PM-related liability to physicians by integrating the doctrinal analysis with the factpatterns in four likely PM case studies, as well as by analyzing lessons from previous examples ofphysician liability relating to new medical technologies and procedures;3. Explore the potential impacts of physician liability on the development and direction of PM, includingphysician practices and patient access to and benefit from PM;4. ldentify and evaluate potential policy options for better management of physician liability risks anduncertainties relating to PM; and5. Conduct outreach on the findings and implications of our research to key stakeholder groups (includingphysicians, physician educators, patient groups, and legal practitioners (including judges}) to help thembetter prepare for and anticipate future liability trends and impacts.Specific Aims Page 45\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSECTION: RESEARCH STRATEGY============================================================[Page 2]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Gary| LIABILITY IN THE DELIVERY OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE:DRIVER, IMPEDIMENT, OR BOTH?RESEARCH STRATEGY]. SignificanceThere are many obstacles affecting the implementation of personalized medicine {PM}, including scientificcomplexity and uncertainty, the need for validation of biomarkers, economic costs, lack of reimbursement fordiagnostic testing, regulatory approval barriers, structural problems in the existing health care delivery system,lack of physician training and motivation, inadequate business models, and intellectual property issues. Onepotentially important factor that has received less attention to date, but which could be enormously influential inthe uptake and future direction of PM, is liability. While liability could potentially affect all actors in the PMlifecycle -- including drug and device manufacturers, test providers and testing labs, health care providers,third-party payors, and pharmacists — physicians are at the greatest risk of liability and their behavior is mostlikely to be influenced by potential liability relating to PM (Marchant et al. 2011; Marchant et al 2006}. Thisproposal will therefore focus on physicians and their patients, and the impact that liability may have on them inthe context of PM.Liability can be a powerful incentive for actors to take appropriate measures to protect public health and safety,or it can skew priorities and practices in socially disadvantageous ways. Thus, liability has the potential to have| both beneficial and detrimental influences on whether and how physicians uptake PM. Liability may speed upthe development and clinical use of some PM technologies and practices, while deterring others.Notwithstanding the potential importance of liability in influencing the future direction and uptake of PM,relatively little is known about, and very little research has been conducted on, the liability risks associated withPM and their likely impacts. This proposed project seeks to fill that gap by providing legal doctrinal, empirical,| and policy research on the risks, impacts and possible policy approaches with regard to PM liability forphysicians. The results of this project can help to better understand and predict the future course of PM, to\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nidentify the key legal and policy levers that may be available to ensure that liability plays a beneficial rather| than detrimental role in the implementation of PM, and to provide guidance to physicians, patients, attorneysand judges on PM liability issues .In this section, we first provide a brief description of PM and its current status, followed by a more extensive| discussion of potential liability risks to physicians and why the potential liability in the burgeoning field of PM isunique and pressing issue that needs to be comprehensively analyzed and addressed.1. Brief Description and Status of Personalized MedicineThe practice of medicine in the United States is on the verge of a profound paradigm shift from the “one sizefits all” approach of the past to individualized care in which a new generation of molecular diagnostics will beused to target treatments to the unique genetic and molecular profile of individual patients and their diseases.As NIH Director Francis Collins recently noted, “[t]he power of the molecular approach to health and diseasehas steadily gained momentum over the past several decades and is now poised to catalyze a revolution inmedicine” (Collins, 2010). Notwithstanding the enormous potential and excitement about the dawning era ofPM, the implementation of PM has turned out to be slower and more complex than many experts originallyanticipated (SACGHS, 2008; The Royal Society, 2005).Today, there is substantial uncertainty and disagreement about the appropriate use of genetics and otherpersonalized medicine data in clinical care, giving rise to the types of disagreemenis and disputes that canspawn litigation. On one hand, some experts claim certain PM techniques are ready for clinical applicationtoday, and several leading medical institutions have begun to deploy such techniques (Personalized MedicineCoalition, 2009; Flockhart et al., 2009; Lesko, 2007). Experts with this perspective have expressed frustrationthat physicians and other stakeholders in the health care system have been too slow to uptake PM methedsand tools (Lesko & Woodcock, 2004; Evans, 2006), Other experts, however, are more skeptical about thenear-term deployment of PM, contending that such methods are not likely to benefit patient care and are notyet ready for widespread adoption (The Royal Society, 2005; Nebert & Vesell, 2004).Research Strategy Page 46[Page 3]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nMarchant, GaryWe are currently at a critical and unsettled juncture in the implementation of PM, where much uncertainty anddisagreement exists about which PM technologies and approaches are ready for use, what outcames they willprovide, and who will pay for them. In such a period of uncertainty, the potential for liability is at its greatest.| 2. Liability Docirines Affecting Personalized MedicineOne factor that may accelerate (appropriately or inappropriately) the widespread clinical use of personalized| medicine is liability (Marchant et al., 2011; SACGHS, 2008; Roth 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Evans, 2006;Ossorio, 2001). A patient who suffers a serious adverse effect from a pharmaceutical for which he or shecarries a genetic susceptibility or a patient whose treatment was adversely affected by the failure to use newgenetic diagnostic techniques in a timely manner may bring a lawsuit against any number of entities across thePM lifecycle, including the physician who prescribed the drug, the drug manufacturer who produced the drug,the manufacturer who developed the diagnostic test, the testing lab that conducted the test, the insurer whichmay not have been willing to pay for a more appropriate genetic test, or the pharmacist that dispensed thedrug. If and when one or more lawsuits are successful, the dynamics of litigation generally are such that newsof the successful litigation will spread quickly among the legal community, and the number of such casesbrought by trial attorneys will quickly skyrocket. If such a dynamic were to be unleashed in the context of PM,the impacts would be enormous. Even a relatively low number of lawsuits would have pervasive effects on howPM is delivered and implemented, since the economic and psychological consequences of liability for anyindividual at-risk party could be substantial.Physicians are likely to be the most at risk for liability relating to PM, mostly because other parties will beprotected by various statutory and common law defenses such as the learned intermediary doctrine {Marchantet al., 2011; Marchant et al., 2006). This is not just a hypothetical issue. There has already been a smatteringof PM-related lawsuits filed against physicians, including: (1) failing to recommend a genetic test beforeprescribing a drug or treatment; (e.g. Downey v. Dunnington, 2008 — physician performed prophylacticmastectomy on woman based on her family history of breast cancer, but was sued for failing to test her for aBRCA mutation first); (2) failing to timely diagnose genetic \n\n--- Page 6 ---\ncondition, thereby leading to loss of chance to treat(e.g. Cardone v. Gunsberger, 2005 — physician liable for taking 3 weeks to diagnose a genetic disorder in aninfant); (3) failing to recognize that family history indicates need for a given diagnostic or screening test (e.g.Bointy-Tsotigh v. U.S., 1996 — physician liable for not recommending early colonoscopy in patient with familyhistory of cancer); (4) for providing an inaccurate diagnosis or prognosis based on genetic tests (e.g.,Gallagher v. Duke University, 1988 — hospital erred in inaccurately reporting results of genetic tests to parents);(5) failure to warn family members about heritable conditions (e.g., Pafe v. Threikel, 1995 — doctor had duty towarn daughter of his patient of genetic risk for cancer);These initial cases are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg. As the scientific knowledge, regulatory approval,and commercial availability of pharmacogenomic tests continues to expand, the potential and likelihood forliability will likewise continue to grow, especially if physicians are resistant to the uptake of these newtechnologies and procedures. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty about the prospects of a medicalmalpractice or other lawsuit brought by patients or other injured persons against their physician alleging thattheir injury was caused or exacerbated by the use or failure to employ PM technologies. The applicable legalscenarios, doctrines and evidentiary requirements relevant for PM liability for physicians are relativelyuncharted, and are not fixed but rather are evolving due to shifting legal and policy trends. The first objectiveof this project will therefore be to identify and evaluate the relevant legal claims, defenses, and docirines thatwill be applicable for potential liability lawsuits against physicians relating to PM, including recent doctrinalchanges and trends that will significantly affect the liability exposure of physicians.For example, to bring a successful medical malpractice case against a physician, a plaintiff must show that (i)the physician had a duly of care to the plaintiff, (ii) the physician breached that duty, (iii} the plaintiff incurred aninjury, and {iv) the physician’s breach caused the plaintiff's injury. The key element of liability exposure is thestandard of care, which is undergoing rapid and significant doctrinal changes (Gostin & Jacobson, 2006). Insome jurisdictions the standard of care is determined by local custom, and if few local physicians are currentlyusing PM tests, a physician who is sued for failing to use adequate methods will not be held to have viclatedthe applicable standard of care. However, some jurisdictions apply a more objective “risk based” test to\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nResearch Strategy Page 47[Page 4]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garydetermine the standard of care, where instead of looking to the common practices of the medical profession,the court locks to whether the physician’s conduct was “reasonable” as determined by a judge or jury (Helling,1974; Peters, 2000}. Under this standard, a physician may be held liable even if the medical community atlarge has not yet adopted the PM test that a patient claims should have been used. Additionally, somejurisdictions are now applying a national standard of care rather than a standard based on local practice andcustom (Lewis et al., 2007). These shifting definitions of the standard of care, along with new claims {e.g.,informed consent) brought against physicians to skirt medical malpractice defenses, are likely to createuncertainty and substantially affect liability risks for physicians relating to PM (Marchant et al. 2006),There are a number of other legal doctrinal trends and changes that will affect PM liability for physicians. Newcauses of action beyond medical malpractice are emerging in the context of genetics and PM. For example,physicians have been held liable in their handling of genetics by failing to obtain fully informed consent relatedto diagnostic and treatment procedures (Granata v. Fruiterman, 668 $.E.2d 127 (2008). These informedconsent claims are increasingly powerful tools for patients, especially as courts transition to a patient-centeredapproach to this doctrine, which requires physicians to disclose all information that reasonable patients wouldconsider material to their decision making (rather than the information that reasonable physicians wouldconsider material, as the traditional doctrine required). Physicians have also been sued for failure te disclosegenetic risks to family members of their patients who refuse to communicate the risk to their relatives, withmixed results (Pate v. Threlkel, 1995; Safer v. Pack, 1996; Molloy v. Meier, 2004). Other important doctrinalchanges, such as those adopted by courts or legislatures affecting “loss of chance” (King, 1981; Renehan,2009}, the learned intermediary doctrine (Calabro, 2004), and standards and procedures for medicalmalpractice cases (Kachalia & Mello, 2011) will also impact significantly the liability potential for physicians inthe PM context.\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n3. Liability Risks in Personalized MedicineWhile the number of lawsuits filed to date against physicians directly involving PM is limited, the number ofcases will likely rise significantly in the next few years. However, little or no empirical analysis or in-depthresearch has been undertaken to date to try to evaluate the likelihood and magnitude of PM lawsuits beingfiled, the likely outcome of those lawsuits, and the impact that such outcomes will have on physician practiceand the implementation of PM. Some important lessons can likely be learned from previous litigation episodesand experiences involving previous medical technologies. A general trend has been that new technologies,even if they improve overall health care, lead to a significant bump up in liability as expectations are increasedand the gap in performance widens between early and slow adopters (Sage, 2003; De Ville, 1998). Such adynamic can be expected with PM.Yet, there are reasons to believe that personalized medicine may present unique liability issues for physicianscompared to past medical technologies, although the project will seek to test this hypothesis. Reasons thatPM may present unique liability dynamics include: (i) unlike other areas of medical practice where specialistswith training and experience in the relevant specialty are applying a new technology or procedure, PM willinvolve the application of genetic information by physicians in virtually every type of practice, most of whemhave no training or expertise in genetics; {ii) there are major uncertainties and disagreements within themedical and scientific communities about the appropriate use of personalized medicine tests at this time(Burke et al., 2010), and such uncertainty is known to be a major factor increasing liability risks (Craswell &Calfee, 1986); and {ili) the rapid pace of technology change in the personalized medicine results in constantlychanging expectations and standards of care that can again greatly increase liability risk (SACGHS, 2008;Marchant et al., 2011).In this present and unique environment, where much uncertainty exists about both the appropriateimplementation of PM and the risks associated with implementing or not implementing specific PM methads,there is an important need for greater information and guidance on liability risks. Physicians, hospitals,malpractice insurers, and other PM stakeholders will be making important decision that are currently based onincomplete or inaccurate impressions of their liability risks. Moreover, once liability has been established andstarts to snowball, it will be too late to take appropriate measures \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nand safeguards to protect agains liability. Atthis critical juncture in the rollout of PM, before widespread liability has taken hold, it would therefore be veryResearch Strategy Page 48[Page 5]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garyimportant and useful to comprehensively study and make widely available the best information and projectionsof the risks and relevant factors for liability relating to PM. Because both the likelihood and outcome of PMlawsuits will be highly fact- and evidence-dependent, it will be necessary to evaluate liability risks in the contextof specific examples in which the applicable legal and evidentiary information is assessed and integrated. Thisattempt to predict the risks of PM liability, integrating both legal doctrine and factual evidence, will be thesecond abjeciive of this proposal.4, is Liability A Problem?The third objective of this project will be to anticipate the potential impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of| physician liability in the PM arena Personal injury liability, including liability for health care professionals, canserve an important social purpose to the extent that it induces actors to take appropriate actions to minimizeunreasonable health risks (Gostin, 2000; Mello, 2006). If individuals are being harmed or denied the best| health care because of the unreasonable failure of physicians to take full advantage of PM knowledge andtechnologies, the threat of liability can be an important driver for implementing sooner and more widely suchbeneficial personalized medicine technologies at the clinical level.On the other hand, problems are created by the enormous, and inevitably growing, uncertainties about theliability risks relating to personalized medicine. This uncertainty is caused by a number of factors including thelack of existing legal precedents in this specific area, the diverse state laws for determining the applicablestandard of care, the lack of authoritative standards for practicing personalized medicine, the divergent expertopinions about the feasibility and effectiveness of existing PM tests, and the uncertainty about how lay jurorswill evaluate claims relating to genetic testing. These pervasive uncertainties about PM liability risks presentseveral potential policy problems. First, physicians may engage in defensive medicine and over-utilize genetictesting in order to protect against liability. Defensive medicine is \n\n--- Page 10 ---\ndefined generally as a deviation from soundmedical practice induced primarily by a threat of liability (OTA, 1994).A physician may practice defensive medicine by performing extra tests or procedures to minimize potentialliability, hoping that the additional testing will reduce adverse medical outcomes, deter patients from filingmalpractice claims, and persuade the legal system that the appropriate standard of care was met. A number ofstudies have suggested that many physicians practice defensive medicine by ordering more diagnostic teststhat would be warranted based on medical considerations alone (Studdert et al., 2005; Birbeck et al, 2004}.Uncertainty about applicable legal standards tends to increase the practice of defensive medicine (Studdert etal., 2005; Fenn et al., 2004), The resulting unnecessary diagnostic tests impose a significant cost on themedical system. The practice of defensive medicine has already been observed in the context of prenatalgenetic testing, for which some commentators have argued that legal standards have over-ridden medicaljudgment in determining when prenatal genetic tests are appropriate (Young, 2003; Howlett et al., 2002;Annas, 1985). In addition, the potential is there for some tests to do more harm than good. FVL is an example.Patients and physicians may be compelled to take action (anticoagulation) that will result in more overall harm(bleeding complications) than benefit (clots prevented) because of not understanding the nature of absoluterisk versus relative risk.In addition to creating pressures for practicing defensive medicine, the uncertainty about applicable liabilitystandards relating to PM will have other adverse effects. For example, the lack of any agreed standards forordering personalized medicine tests will results in different standards of care, with some physicians beingmore proactive on ordering such tests and others being slower to adopt these new tools. Patients may thus beprovided with inconsistent care if decisions are being influenced by legal concerns on an ad hoc basis.Given these potential counter-productive consequences from the uncertainties and risks of PM liability, it is nottoo early to begin considering policy options — at either the private or public levels — to address theseproblems. Even less work has been done on solutions to the liability problem far PM than has been devoted to| identifying the risks of liability. The fourth objective of this project will be to identify potential policy initiatives toprovide greater certainty to PM actors and thus to reduce liability risks and uncertainties. Almost no work has\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nbeen done on liability prevention in the PM context to date, but some of the ideas that will be explored includebetier business models to integrate drugs and companion diagnostic tests, clinical guidelines that recommendbest practices, better training of physicians and other health professionals, regulatory changes and otherResearch Strategy Page 49[Page 6]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garypossible solutions (Evans, 2007; Roth, 2007; Evans, 2006; Marchant et al., 2006).Finally, there is an important need to educate affected stakeholders and policymakers about the potential risksand impacts of liability for PM. For example, physicians, PM policymakers, medical guidelines writers,regulators, and medical educators need to have realistic expectations about the potential for liability in thissphere as PM emerges as the dominant medical model of this century. Patients, the group who will poteritiallybring such lawsuits, and the stakeholders who could be most affected by both the beneficial and detrimentalpotential impacts of liability, need to be aware of liability issues and become proactive in the inevitable policyand legal baitles relating to liability. Finally, the practitioners in the legal liability field, including lawyers, expertwitnesses and judges, also would benefit from clear and informative information about liability. Thus, the fifthobjective of ihe proposal will be to conduct outreach on the findings of this project to key stakeholder groupsincluding physicians, patient groups and legal practitioners.ll. InnovationMuch research has been done on the scientific, medical, regulatory, economic, educational, intellectualproperty, ethical and public policy aspects of personalized medicine. In contrast, very little doctrinal, empiricalor theoretical work has been done on the issue of liability in the PM field, notwithstanding frequent references| to the importance of the issue for PM (e.g., SACGHS, 2008, p. 47; Sorrel, 2008, NRC, 2007). Only a handful ofshort, preliminary analyses emphasizing the potential importance of this subject have been published to date| (Marchant, 2011; Roth, 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Evans, 2007; Rothstein, 2005; Osscrio, 2001}. The risks,relevant key factors, impacts, and possible solutions relating to potential PM liability are largely unknown andhave been under-studied to date. There is much that could be done to provide beneficial further information,\n\n--- Page 12 ---\ntrends, predictions, and proposed policy interventions to address this largely uncharted subjected that ts likelyto play a critical role in the implementation of PM over the next decade. The knowledge generated by research| on these issues would likely prove very useful in helping physicians, patient groups, legal practitioners andother various stakeholders in PM to make informed decisions relating to the risks and prevention of liability.The present proposal therefore addresses a conspicuous gap in the knowledge base and available literatureon PM. To fill this gap, it is important to not anly have a good knowledge of law and legal research, but also ofthe scientific, medical, economic, and policy dimensions of PM, because these integrate with the law inunderstanding, predicting and preventing liability. In this proposal, we have attempted to address the need forsuch an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach in two innovative ways. First, the research teamincorporates a broad range of relevant training, experience and expertise necessary to address the multi-dimensional and complex issues of PM liability. The Pl (Gary Marchant) is trained as both a geneticist andlawyer, and has worked on liability issues relating to genetics for the past decade, including publishingnumerous articles on such issues and serving as lead organizer of three previous conferences and workshopson genetics liability issues. Co-Investigator Doug Campos-Outcalt is a medical schoo] professor involved intraining future physicians and who has worked and written on physician uptake of PM genetic tests, and hasserved on the CDC’s EGAPP (Evidence based Genomics Applied in Practice and Prevention) group evaluatingthe clinical readiness of PM tests. Co-Investigator Amalia Issa is a scientist whose work focuses on how PMapplications will be translated and integrated into clinical practice, health care delivery and health systems,including studying physician and patient perspectives on PM uptake. Consultant Scott Ramsey is a physicianand health economist whose work examines economic factors affecting clinical uptake of new medicaltechnologies and procedures. Consultant Paul Wicks is Director of Research and Development atPatientsLikeMe and works on new approaches and models for patient participation and engagement in theirown healthcare. Consultant Rachel Lindor is a lawyer currently completing her MD training at Mayo MedicalSchool who has conducted research on medical liability and reimbursement issues relating to PM, including aposter presentation on liability issues relating to PM at this year’s American Society for Clinical Oncology\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nannual conference.Second, we plan to directly engage key stakeholders in the project through our consultants and supporters onthe project and using our extensive existing network of contacts in the PM field. The stakeholder engagementis discussed further in the Research Approach section (below).Research Strategy Page 50[Page 7]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garylll. Research ApproachThis project will proceed in three steps, roughly segmented by the three years of the proposal. The first yearwill be devoted to identifying relevant legal doctrine, including potential claims, criteria, and defenses for thewide variety of liability lawsuits that might be anticipated against physicians related to PM lifecycle.. In thesecond year, we will assess the risk of liability for physicians relating to PM, by integrating the doctrinalanalysis with the specific factual and evidentiary data for four PM case studies. We will also look to previousexamples of physician liability relating to new medical technologies for relevant lessons and projections for PM.Finally, in the third year, we will address two objectives. First, we will investigate impacts of liability onphysicians, patients and society more generally as well explore possible policy options for addressing thepotential liability risks and uncertainties relating to PM. Second, we will adapt and customize our findings forrelevant stakeholders groups and undertake outreach on our findings to those sectors, including physicians,patient groups, medical educators, and malpractice insurers.| Year One: identifying Liability Claims and DoctrineThe first year will invelve identifying and assessing the applicable Jegal claims and doctrines that may beapplicable to PM lawsuits against physicians. As discussed above, the legal landscape applicable to suchlawsuits has been undergoing significant change in recent years, with major potential implications for thechances of PM lawsuits against physicians being filed and succeeding. The first year of the project will bedevoted to a comprehensive scoping of the legal landscape for PM liability of physicians. This work will includetwo lines of research.The first line of research will be to identify, analyze and catalogue every reported case in the United States inwhich a physician was sued relating to PM or genetic testing in other medical contexts (e.g., prenatal genetic\n\n--- Page 14 ---\ntesting). We anticipate finding 100-200 relevant judicial decisions. For each case, we will identify the relevantlegal claims brought against the physician, as well as the outcome of the case and the key factual evidence,expert opinions, reliance on authoritative statements or professional guidelines, defenses, or other factors thatled to the outcome. In addition to looking at the reported decision, we will also review court filings and briefsand expert opinions filed in significant cases when accessible. From this data set, we will distill some overallfindings as to the range and dimensions of possible legal claims that could be brought against physicians in thePM context and the key factors likely to determine the outcome of those claims based on the historical legalprecedents. The list and characterization of cases will be posted on a public website created to communicatethe results of this project.| The second line of research in year one will be to evaluate some of the key legal doctrinal issues that are likelyto affect liability relating to PM. PM liability risks will be dependent on some key legal doctrines that arecurrently evolving and are in flux, including:a. Sfandard of care for medical malpractice: Medical malpractice is based on whether a physicianbreached the applicable standard for care. As discussed in more detail above, the standard of care forphysicians is currently undergoing significant change. The standard of care has traditionally beendefined by custom in the locality in which the physician practices, but in many jurisdictions the standardhas been evolving from a local to a national standard, and from a duty based on custom to a moreobjective standard. These and other changes in how the standard of care is defined are likely to havesignificant impacts on PM liability risks for physicians (Lewis et al., 2007; Marchant et al., 2006; Peiers,2000}. Moreover, important legislative and policy initiatives relating to medical malpractice are beingimplemented or considered across the nation (Kachalia & Mello, 2011), and these too cauldsignificantly affect the prospects for PM physician liability.b. Learned intermediary doctrine - The learned intermediary doctrine shifts responsibility (andassociated liability) for failure to warn a patient from a drug or device manufacturer to the prescribingphysician if the manufacturer included an appropriate warning in the praduct materials received by thephysician (i.e., patient package insert for a pharmaceutical), The applicability and scope of this doctrineis currently being challenged, with two states (New Jersey and W. \n\n--- Page 15 ---\nVirginia) recently deciding ta nolonger recognize the defense, a trend which if it continues could have major implications for PM liabilityResearch Strategy Page 51[Page 8]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Gary(Perez, 1999; Calabro, 2004).c. Role of clinical guidelines — Various organizations have produced clinical guidelines to attempt toguide health care professionals to make appropriate clinical decisions. The role that such clinicalguidelines should play in defining the standard of care in a medical malpractice case is still evolving.The role and weight that judges and juries extend to clinical guidelines in medical malpractice cases willpotentially play an important role in determining PM liability risks (SCGHS8, 2008; Evans, 2006).d. Loss of chance — In most PM liability cases, a physician’s negligence will not “cause” the plainttif’sinjury, which will often be pre-existing to the doctor's treatment (e.g., cancer or cancer predisposition).Rather than causing the plaintiff's illness, the physician’s actions may have reduced the probability thatthe plaintiff might have been successfully treated. Notwithstanding the lack of causation per se, courtshave gradually permitted recovery for the “loss of a chance” of survival under certain circurnstances(King 1981}. The recognition and criteria for allowing a plaintiff to receive compensation for loss ofchance have been evolving in recent years (Renehan, 2009), and the availability and scope of thiscause of action will be critical to the viability of many potential PM lawsuits.The shifting status, application and criteria for these important legal doctrines affecting potential PM lawsuitswill be analyzed through a review of key court decisions and secondary materials. The results of this doctrinalanalysis will be integrated with the case law analysis and will be published in one or more journal manuscriptsprepared at the end of year one of the project.| Year Two: Evaluating PM Liability RisksAs discussed above, there has been no in-depth research or analysis on the level of risk that physicians arelikely to face in the PM context — in terms of both the likelihood of facing a lawsuit and the probable outcome ofsuch lawsuits. In the second year of the project, we will undertake two projects to help elucidate the risks of\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nliability and the key factors influencing such risks. The first task will analyze previous lawsuits againstphysicians relating to their failure to use, premature use, or faulty use of new medical technologies. We willexamine the results and important factors in individual lawsuits, as well as the dynamics of the litigation relatingto that technology as a class. In reviewing individual cases, we will evaluate why physicians were held liable insome cases and not in others, discerning the key factors, evidence and legal rules that influenced theoutcome. In looking at classes at cases, we will seek fo understand the dynamics of the litigation,investigating such questions as; What was the time line of the cases? How did a positive or negative outcomefor the plaintiff affect the rate of new cases against that same technology? Were the cases brought by thesame plaintiffs’ lawyers, or were there a variety of lawyers? These types of trends can help provide insights onthe dynamics of litigation — for example, is there likely to be a steady trickle of such cases, or will the casescome in clusters or bursts of lawsuits?In choosing and undertaking this analysis of other litigation against physicians for their utilization (or lackthereof) of new medical technologies, we will start our research with some major secondary sources on theissue of technology and medical malpractice litigation (e.g., Sage, 2003; De Ville, 1998) to help us identify themost promising and informative technology precedents to analyze in depth. We will then pick 3-5 medicaltechnologies that have been the subject of significant litigation against physicians and collect and analyze theprimary cases involving those technologies. The chjective will be to draw lessons from these previousexamples (recognizing and addressing the various ways that PM litigation may differ because of itsuniqueness) about the risks and dynamics of such litigation. In addition to this broader question, thiscomparative and historical analysis will enable us to focus in on specific factors that might affect liability. Forexample, one question that will be pursued is what impact does decisions by CMS and private insurers tocover or not cover a specific technology or procedure affect the potential liability of physicians with respect totheir use (or non-use) of that technology or procedure (the difficulty in obtaining reimbursement for manygenetic tests currently is an important impediment to the uptake of PM by physicians). We will publish ourfindings on the more general trends as well as specific factors that can affect liability (e.g., insurance coverage}in an academic journal.\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nThe second task will be to look at four case studies involving different uses of PM technologies te evaluate theResearch Strategy Page 52[Page 9]Principal Investigator’Program Director {Lasi, first, middle}: Marchant, Garypotential risks of physician liability. The risk of liability will depend in significant part on the factual andscientific evidence about the effectiveness, safety, clinical utility and cost of the specific tests that the plaintiffalleges the physician failed to use, used prematurely, or used incorrectly, combined with the applicable legaldoctrines discussed above. Because liability risks will be fact- and context-specific, the risks can best beevaluated by using case studies to assess the potential for liability in specific contexts. We have identified thefollowing four case studies to evaluate, each involving a different type of PM test:a. Warfarin (Coumadin): Warfarin is one of the most discussed drugs with respect to whetherphysicians should require a genetic test before prescribing the drug {Wadelius & Pirmohamed, 2007}.Warfarin has a very narrow therapeutic index and the safe dose for an individual patient can vary basedon a number of factors including polymorphisms in two genes (CYP2C9 and VKORC), If the initial doseis too high for the individual patient, a serious bleeding event can result. The FDA revised the label forwarfarin in 2007 {and again in 2009) to give greater emphasis to the potential benefits of genetic testingfor initial dose determination, and a number of experts and organizations (e.g., CMS, Mayo/Medcc)have offered inconsistent opinions on whether genetic testing is warranted {Epstein et al., 2010; Lenziniet al. 2010; Kamali & Wynne, 2010; CMS, 2009; Roth, 2009). A number of other studies are underway,including randemized clinical trials, so the evidentiary support for genetic testing may change over time.The case for genetic testing prior to prescribing warfarin therefore remains uncertain and contested.This case study will evaluate whether a physician who fails to genetically test a patient prior to\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nprescribing warfarin might be held liable if that patient suffers a serious or fatal reaction as a result ofthe failure to recommend genetic testing prior to initial dosing.b. Gene expression diagnostic tests — A variety of diagnostic products using gene expression assaysare available or being developed to profile tumors or infectious disease agents to predict prognosis orrisk of recurrence. For example, the Oncotype Dx® diagnostic test used gene expression analysis topredict the risk of recurrence of breast cancer, which can then be used to make decisions aboutwhether procedures such as chemotherapy are necessary {Snoo et al., 2009; EGAPP, 2009; Satiriou &Pusztai, 2009). It is possible that a physician could be sued either for using the test prematurely (beforeits use had been validated) or for not using the test at all.c. BRCA testing - Among the strongest and best validated disease predisposition genes are theBRCA1/2 genes for breast cancer, as women carrying a mutation in either of these genes have a 50-85percent risk of breast or ovarian cancer (Robson & Offit, 2007). Interventions such as prophylacticbilateral radical mastectomies and oophorectomies have been shown to substantially reduce the risk ofcancer in asymptomatic women carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation (Robson & Offit, 2007). Various expertevidentiary reviews have recommended genetic testing of women who have certain risk factors forcarrying one of these mutations, such as having two first-degree female relatives who have developedbreast cancer. A physician could potentially be sued if he or she sees an asymptomatic patient with astrong family history of breast cancer, but dees not recommend the patient undergo genetic counselingor BRCA testing. If that patient subsequently develops breast cancer, she or her surviving familymembers could bring a lawsuit alleging that the physician breached a duty to warn her of her potentialgenetic risk, and the failure to recommend genetic testing resulted in the patient’s “loss of chance” tohave prevented or successfully treated the disease.d. Whole Genome Sequencing: The final case study involves a very recent type of genetic testing thatis only in early research stages at this time but could become part of clinical care relatively quickly in atleast some practices. The potential for rapid adoption of whole genome sequencing may fuel adiscrepancy in care that could leave slower adopter physicians and provider institutions at risk ofliability. This technique is already being used in the research \n\n--- Page 19 ---\ncontext, for example, to sequence theentire genome of a cancer patient's tumor and compare it to that same patient’s inherited genome(Boneita, 2010; Ormend, et al., 2007). Genetic changes revealed in tumors using this comparativeapproach could be used to identify otherwise unexpected treatment regimes that target the particularmolecular identity of the tumor. Although this method has only been used in research studies on arelatively small number of patients to date, the results today are promising and have generatedsignificant interest in the method. While the technique is too expensive and experimental to be used inroutine cancer care now, leading institutions and physicians may adopt the technology on selectedResearch Strategy Page 53",

I have carefully reviewed this proposal on \"Liability in the Delivery of Personalized Medicine: Driver, Impediment, or Both?\" and will provide a critical evaluation to identify potential weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\n**Critique of Agent A's Review**\n\n**Factor 1: Importance of the Research**\nThe initial review appropriately identifies the significance of examining liability as a barrier to personalized medicine implementation. However, the review could be strengthened by:\n- More explicitly addressing whether this legal research truly represents an innovative approach versus incremental advancement in health policy research\n- Questioning whether the focus on physician liability alone (versus broader stakeholder liability) artificially narrows the innovation potential\n- Examining if the proposal adequately justifies why liability deserves equal weight with other well-established PM barriers (reimbursement, clinical validation, etc.)\n\n**Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility**\nSeveral methodological concerns warrant deeper scrutiny:\n- The case study selection appears convenience-based rather than systematically justified\n- The proposal lacks clear criteria for how the 100-200 anticipated legal cases will be systematically coded and analyzed\n- The \"vulnerability analysis\" approach mentioned is not clearly defined methodologically\n- Timeline feasibility is questionable given the ambitious scope (comprehensive legal doctrine analysis, 100-200 case reviews, stakeholder engagement) within 3 years\n- Statistical analysis plans are entirely absent despite claims of empirical research\n\n**Factor 3: Expertise and Resources**\nWhile marked as \"Sufficient,\" this assessment may be overly generous:\n- The team lacks a biostatistician or empirical legal researcher despite claims of conducting empirical analysis\n- No evidence of established partnerships with medical malpractice insurers or healthcare systems for data access\n- Limited expertise in implementation science or health services research to assess real-world PM adoption impacts\n\n**Additional Review Criteria**\nThe review inadequately addresses:\n- Lack of human subjects considerations for proposed stakeholder engagement activities\n- Absence of data sharing plans for the proposed public database of PM liability cases\n- No discussion of how findings will be disseminated to influence policy\n\n**Overall Impact Score Justification**\nThe assigned score appears inflated given:\n- Methodological weaknesses in the empirical components\n- Narrow disciplinary focus that may limit translational impact\n- Insufficient justification for why this legal analysis will meaningfully accelerate PM implementation\n- Limited evidence that stakeholder engagement will translate to practice change\n\n**Summary**\nThis proposal addresses a potentially important but narrowly defined aspect of PM implementation barriers. The heavy emphasis on doctrinal legal analysis without robust empirical methods, limited interdisciplinary integration, and unclear pathways to impact suggest this may represent more of a scholarly legal review than transformative health services research. The review should more critically evaluate whether this represents the optimal use of NIH funds for advancing personalized medicine implementation.",

Your task is to critically analyze this response and identify any flaws, weaknesses, unsupported claims, logical inconsistencies, or areas that need improvement:\n\nDr. Jennifer Grundman,\n\nI am R01_Marchant_C_Grundman_Reviewer, your AI assistant for structured NIH grant peer review. Below is a detailed and section-by-section analytical evaluation of “Liability in the Delivery of Personalized Medicine: Driver, Impediment, or Both?” (PI: Gary Marchant), following NIH review guidelines.\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL IMPACT\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- This proposal addresses a highly significant, underexplored policy and legal barrier to personalized medicine (PM) adoption: the role of liability in influencing the pace and nature of PM uptake, especially by physicians.\n- The research plan is multidisciplinary, integrating legal doctrine, empirical data, policy analysis, and specific case studies. This approach is well-matched to the nuances of the topic and likely to produce actionable insights.\n- The planned dissemination to stakeholder groups (physicians, educators, legal professionals, patients) enhances expected impact beyond academia.\n- The research team is strong and notably interdisciplinary, with overlapping expertise in genetics, law, health economics, and clinical practice.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- Success is contingent on the complexity of bridging legal and empirical research; the proposal could address logistical risks and mitigation strategies more explicitly.\n- The policy translation component, while valuable, is not fully fleshed out in terms of engagement methods, timing, or measurable stakeholder outcomes.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Clarify the approach for integrating doctrinal and empirical findings, especially methodological details for the case studies and stakeholder outreach.\n- Provide a specific logic model or milestones for the impact on target stakeholders, including how recommendations might be turned into changes in practice or policy.\n\n---\n\n## 1. SIGNIFICANCE\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Identifies an urgent knowledge gap: liability’s under-appreciated (but potentially major) impact as both a driver and impediment to PM.\n- Frames the issue in terms of both theoretical risk and concrete recent cases, illustrating real-world relevance.\n- Links the project to broader health system concerns—overuse of testing, defensive medicine, access barriers, inconsistent care practices—which are timely and important for healthcare delivery.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The discussion of broader impacts (e.g., cost implications of defensive medicine, patient outcomes) could benefit from greater quantification or connection to available literature/data.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Consider incorporating more anticipated quantitative impacts (e.g., cost of increased defensive medicine or delays in PM adoption) to strengthen the argument that liability deserves urgent study.\n\n---\n\n## 2. INVESTIGATORS\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The PI is uniquely credentialed (geneticist and legal scholar), with numerous relevant publications and conference leadership in genetics liability.\n- Co-investigators and consultants have strong, relevant backgrounds in PM implementation, epidemiology, economics, and patient engagement.\n- The team’s composition ensures expertise in all key domains necessary for the project: law, clinical medicine, economic analysis, and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The roles of some consultants (especially in long-term dissemination or policy action) could be more clearly defined.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Provide a more granular chart (or table) outlining specific responsibilities and percent effort for each team member and consultant, particularly related to stakeholder outreach and manuscript production.\n\n---\n\n## 3. INNOVATION\n\n**SCORE:** 1\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Fills a conspicuous gap: legal and liability issues in PM have received minimal doctrinal or policy analysis despite being frequently cited as critical.\n- The interdisciplinary approach (integrating legal precedent, empirical case studies, and stakeholder perspectives) is novel and well-suited to the topic.\n- The project’s combination of doctrinal review, empirical case-by-case legal synthesis, and real-world policy illustration is highly original.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The proposal could further emphasize how its findings might influence or reframe existing models of adoption in PM, or medical legal education, on a national scale.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Extend the innovation narrative by specifying how the project's data and recommendations might set a roadmap for parallel studies in other emerging medical domains (e.g., digital health, AI diagnostics).\n\n---\n\n## 4. APPROACH\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- Presents a clear, staged plan: (1) catalog national case law; (2) doctrinal/legal analysis (malpractice, standards of care, informed consent, loss of chance, etc.); (3) empirical evaluation via four high-value case studies; (4) policy tools assessment and outreach.\n- Plan to systematically review hundreds of cases and integrate findings is robust.\n- Multiple sources (court records, published judicial decisions, expert reviews, stakeholder interviews) suggest thoroughness.\n- Case selection addresses diversity in PM applications (therapeutic gene interaction, new diagnostics, hereditary risk, rapidly evolving genomics tests).\n- The discussion of legal doctrines likely to shift—standard of care, learned intermediary, role of guidelines, loss of chance—is sophisticated and current.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- The methodologies for empirical synthesis and stakeholder outreach are not detailed—criteria for case study selection, analytic framework, or dissemination metrics could be better specified.\n- Potential limitations (e.g., generalizability, accessing sufficient unpublished court materials, or dealing with future technologies not yet litigated) are not comprehensively discussed.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Include a well-defined analytic framework for both doctrinal synthesis and case study comparison.\n- Expand on stakeholder outreach: specify communication channels (webinars, CME content, policy briefs, etc.) and target audiences, with expected metrics for impact or uptake.\n- Acknowledge and address limitations in court records access and generalizability to rapidly evolving technologies.\n\n---\n\n## 5. ENVIRONMENT\n\n**SCORE:** 2\n\n**STRENGTHS:**  \n- The investigative team is based at institutions supportive of interdisciplinary legal-medical research.\n- Access to relevant data (legal databases, clinical partners for case study data, PM policy/medical communities) is likely robust.\n- Strong existing network for dissemination, including contacts with PM guidelines organizations, professional societies, and policy groups.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**  \n- More details on the institutional support for data sharing/collaboration or technology transfer pathways could be included.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n- Provide letters or evidence of institutional commitment to support cross-disciplinary research infrastructure and stakeholder engagement.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY PARAGRAPH\n\nThis proposal addresses a critical, underexplored translational barrier to personalized medicine: the evolving landscape of physician liability. Its strengths include a strong interdisciplinary team, a robust and detailed approach, and the potential to shape practice and policy nationwide. The project is both scientifically and socially significant, filling a major gap in PM policy research and offering recommendations that could realign adoption incentives, reduce barriers, and inform guideline writers and policymakers.\n\nKey weaknesses are primarily related to operational detail—particularly in rigorously linking legal and empirical work, and in outlining methods for measurable stakeholder impact and dissemination. With stronger definitions of analytic methodology and outreach mechanics, the project stands to contribute transformative knowledge with widespread application to the realization of personalized medicine. \n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nApprove with minor revision—clarify methodologies for empirical analysis and outreach, and provide specific benchmarks for measuring policy and educational impact.",

The reviewer failed to provide an integrated assessment.\n\n3. **Insufficient Innovation Justification**: While claiming the approach is \"highly original,\" the reviewer provides limited evidence of methodological novelty beyond stating it's \"interdisciplinary.\" How does this differ from standard legal-medical research approaches?\n\n### Factor 2: Rigor and Feasibility\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n\n1. **Missing Required Elements**: The review completely omits discussion of:\n   - Statistical analysis plans\n   - Reproducibility measures\n   - Inclusion of diverse populations\n   - Human subjects protections (should be in this factor, not just additional criteria)\n\n2. **Methodological Gaps Underaddressed**: The reviewer acknowledges \"methodologies for empirical synthesis... are not detailed\" but still assigns a score of 2 (exceptional). This represents a major inconsistency.\n\n3. **Feasibility Concerns Minimized**: The acknowledged \"complexity of bridging legal and empirical research\" is noted as a weakness but not adequately reflected in the scoring.\n\n### Factor 3: Expertise and Resources\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n\n1. **Incorrect Format**: The reviewer assigned a numerical score (2) rather than the required binary \"Sufficient/Insufficient\" designation.\n\n2. **Missing Environmental Assessment**: Limited discussion of institutional resources beyond vague mentions of \"supportive institutions.\"\n\n### Additional Review Criteria\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n\n1. **Complete Omission**: The review entirely fails to address required sections:\n   - Human Subjects protections\n   - Vertebrate Animals (N/A should be stated)\n   - Biohazards\n   - Resubmission/Renewal/Revisions status\n\n### Additional Considerations\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n\n1. **Missing Sections**: No discussion of:\n   - Authentication of Key Resources\n   - Budget and Period of Support\n\n### Overall Impact Score\n**Critical Issues Identified:**\n\n1. **Score-Justification Mismatch**: An Overall Impact score of 2 (High) seems overly generous given the acknowledged methodological gaps, missing operational details, and implementation uncertainties.\n\n2. **Insufficient Weakness Integration**: The summary paragraph minimizes significant weaknesses as merely \"operational detail\" when they represent fundamental methodological concerns.\n\n3. **Conflicting Recommendation**: \"Approve with minor revision\" is not an appropriate NIH review outcome—reviews should score based on the proposal as submitted.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis review demonstrates multiple critical flaws:\n\n1. **Framework Non-Compliance**: Uses outdated criterion-based scoring rather than the mandated three-factor Simplified Framework\n2. **Incomplete Assessment**: Omits multiple required review elements\n3. **Scoring Inconsistencies**: High scores despite acknowledged significant methodological weaknesses\n4. **Missing Critical Analysis**: Fails to adequately address reproducibility, statistical rigor, and human subjects protections\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n- Restructure using the correct three-factor framework\n- Provide integrated Factor 1 score combining Significance and Innovation\n- Use Sufficient/Insufficient for Factor 3\n- Complete all required Additional Review Criteria sections\n- Align scoring with identified weaknesses\n- Remove inappropriate revision recommendations\n\nThe review requires substantial revision to meet NIH Simplified Peer Review Framework standards.",
